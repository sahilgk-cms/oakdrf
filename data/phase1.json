More youth are likely to pursue vocational training, which leads to higher employment rates, reduced poverty, and overall economic upliftment within the community.

This cultural shift is critical for sustainable development, as it encourages continuous improvement, adaptability, and resilience in the workforce.  Alignment with Sustainable Livelihoods: By promoting vocational-led employment, this change directly supports the goal of sustainable livelihoods. It reduces dependency on unstable or informal employment and helps build a more robust and diverse local economy.
