Through these efforts, the communities have become aware of their needs and govt. measures which can address some of those needs. Indigenous women have become proactive in accessing their rights and govt. facilities. Several community members who had applied to the Tribal Welfare Dept. for caste certification have received their certificates. In addition now PRI members, BDO and other relevant govt. officials have begun to train their focus on developmental initiatives at the village level so that nobody is left behind. The communities have continued to visit govt. camps, departments, and other relevant offices as needed, with no hesitation.",

They have begun to cultivate indigenous varieties of crops using seeds they received through the project and have also developed seed banks at the Information Hubs for future use. Seeds are also being saved at the household level as communities have become aware of their importance in sustainable agriculture.

People preserving indigenious seeds at the household level has contributed to an increase in their control over farming. Women's decisionmaking agency has increased even in matters of agriculture, especially with regard to crop selection. Organic nutrition gardening has brought about a major positive change in the communities' food habits and nutrition intake as they now consume chemical-free produce and more vegetables and fruits than they did before. This has improved food and nutrition security in the project villages.   They regularly consume indigenous varieties of rice, pulses, animal protein, and a variety of vegetables, all organically grown on their own farms.",

The communities were also encouraged to document their traditional song and dance performances on auspicious ocassions through photos, videos and audio recordings, which served as an encouragement to them, especially the younger generations, to practice the oral and performative aspects of their culture, which is also expected to contribute to improved mental, social, cultural and overall wellbeing of the communities.
