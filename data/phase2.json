They have transitioned to organic and mixed farming approaches on both their own lands and shared lands, demonstrating increased awareness and capacity to practice sustainable farming. This shift indicates a behavioral change towards climate resilience, reducing dependency on chemical inputs, and enhancing soil health and productivity.",

The adoption of climate-smart, organic, and mixed farming methods demonstrates:1. Increased Awareness & Capacity – Farmers are actively applying sustainable farming techniques, showing that they understand the benefits of reducing chemical dependency and improving soil health.2. Community-Led Adaptation – The shift is not limited to individual farmers but extends across 20 farmer groups, indicating collective action and peer learning.3. Utilization of Shared Lands – The inclusion of hare (shared) lands suggests an expansion of sustainable farming beyond individual holdings, fostering resource optimization and cooperation.4. Climate Resilience & Sustainability – By adopting organic and mixed practices, farmers are better prepared to handle climate variability, ensuring long-term food security and livelihood stability.This change aligns with the program’s vision of climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture by:• Strengthening Livelihoods – Encouraging diverse, eco-friendly agricultural practices contributes to income stability and food security.• Enhancing Environmental Sustainability – Reducing chemical use improves soil fertility, biodiversity, and water conservation.• Scaling Sustainable Solutions – The adoption by multiple farmer groups demonstrates the replication potential of climate-smart practices, paving the way for wider policy or practice shifts.• Empowering Local Communities – By equipping farmers with knowledge and skills, the initiative fosters community ownership of sustainable agricultural solutions.This observation signifies progress toward the program's broader goal—enhancing farmers' resilience against climate change while promoting sustainable agro-ecological transitions",
