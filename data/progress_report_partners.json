AID promotes sustainable, equitable, and just development. It supports grassroots organisations in India working on education, livelihoods, natural resources, agriculture, health, gender, and social justice.    7.",
        "Progress Against Objectives": "Progress Against Objectives Under each expected project objective, briefly explain your progress in reaching the objective and its results, and discuss any changes you propose to the project goals or objectives with the PO.  7.1.a. Objective 1 Use the Forest Rights Act to claim legal rights for individuals and communities and strengthen grassroots democratic institutions in 200 villages across 4 districts of northern West Bengal.   7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments Very good ground mobilis ation despite the pandemic. The following meetings at various levels were organised. 20 community level meetings were organised with 40 participants on an average. Any adult in the village can attend this type of open meeting. In some places women participation is less as they go to work in others homes for domestic help or they go to forest for foraging. Increasing livelihood options in the village will help womens increase participation. The purpose of these meetings was to provide basic orientation on the FRA and talk about the provisions under FRA to start new Gram Sabhas. 1 district level meeting was organised where Gram Sabha members from 30 villages spread across 3 districts had participated. Basically, the district meeting was organised to raise awa reness around FRA so that representatives would go back to their respective villages and work with other villagers in order to strengthen their Gram Sabhas. Sometimes people don't realise that they got less land while getting the Patta. Those who have rece ived less land under IFR are going back to the district officials. Those villages that have not been converted to revenue villages have started the process as a result of this meeting. 3 alliance building meetings with like -minded organisations were organi sed in Nagpur, Kolkata and in Purulia. Different groups related to forest issues from different districts have participated in the meetings so that the FRA is implemented better across the state. Village level leadership committees were formed in 7 villages to drive the community processes through Gram Sabhas. Capacity building workshop on GPS & satellite mapping is going on for CFR mapping in the operational forest villages with the Gram Sabha representatives so that they can authenticate their cust omary forest boundary and claim CFR with the map. Besides, the regular meetings, interactions with the forest and district administration are being continued because the implementation of FRA has to be recognized by the government. FRA guidelines are not being followed. The process is not done correctly by the government hence people have to repeatedly go for the correction of land records, ensure their representation in the Sub Divisional Level Committee (SDLC) and bringing issues back in the village.     7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls The starting of developing the audio-visual materials have been delayed due to Covid pandemic.     7.2.a. Objective 2 To create livelihood opportunities for the communities living in and around the forest  to  build their resilience and encourage conservation of forests and the surrounding landscape.   7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments The outcomes of the livelihood activities have surpassed our own expectations. People were mobilised in 25 villages to form clusters for community level farming. Around 680 families involved in farming have reaped a harvest in jute, mustard and vegetables.   300 families were involved in Jute farming and each family had made an average additional income of Rs.27,000  350 families were involved in mustard farming and each family had made an additional income of around Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000. The marketing of mustard oil is in the process. People in these clusters have brought 330 acres of land under mustard cultivation.  35 families in Nimati village were involved in vegetable farming and each made an additional income of Rs.600 All of these are additional income for the families because earlier they used to grow rice and then the land remained unused for the rest of the year. Rice is mainly grown for sustenance. Most of the villagers in the operational area are daily wage earners. On an average they earn around Rs.300 per day as labourers. Usually they get 4 months of work in a year which earns around Rs.36,000 annually per family. The clusters involved in farming have been able to make some additional income on top of their annual income from labour work  because of this livelihood initiative.   There have been some farmers who grow jute for which they  take a loan of Rs.400 for a bigha (0.33 acre) from the money lender. And farmers who were involved in commercial mustard farming used to take a loan of Rs.5000 to 600 per  bigha (0.33 acre)  for the initial input costs. This year the situation has changed or got better in a way because the cluster got the seed and other input support for farming and also had a good income from the harvest.  Apart from the farming initiatives, 2 nurseries have been raised in different villages with a total of 80,000 saplings of local indigenous varieties from the forest. The plantation will happen in monsoon season on all the degraded lands along the customary boundaries of the forest villages.  Formal meetings with all the Gram Sabhas in 25 villages happened and resolutions were passed in order to initiate the farming and plantation work in the forest villages. Several follow up meetings with the Gram Sabha and the clusters had been carried out to start the newly adopted livelihood initiative. Besides, some workshops on the technical aspect of organic farming were also organised in 25 villages with the farmers involved in clusters.     7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls We are a bit late in terms of plantation effort because the seed collection was delayed  due to the Covid induced lockdown. Plantation is a time sensitive work. We missed the first plantation time because of the delayed seed collection and we had to wait for the next plantation time. On top of that the first batch of saplings got destroyed by the elephants for which we had to change the location of one of the nurseries.      7.3.a. Objective 3 To develop a new rung of leadership from the youth (12 to 18 years) through an education that is rooted in their socio-cultural-ecological context and empowers them to develop self-reliance and live in their culture with dignity.   7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments We could not organise any formal workshops in the initial months of the project due to Covid pandemic. However,  several rounds of discussion have been done with the adolescents and youth (aged between 12 to 18 years old) both including men and women in different villages. Based on those interactions we are now developing the learning modules which will be completed by April, 2022.  Due to the enthusiasm from the community we increased the learning centre from six to seven. Selection of teachers through an interview process from the community has been done. We are in the process of buying one desktop for each centre. We observed the FRA day on December 18th in which people from different villages participated, and community members of different tribes presented their unique cultural performances.   7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls We could not organise any formal workshops on planned time for developing the learning modules due to the Covid pandemic. However, our experts (resource persons) have visited all the targeted villages several times in order to interact with the women and youth groups in the process of dev eloping basic learning modules.  No school level competitions could be done because schools were closed due to the Covid-19 induced restrictions.      8.",
        "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? 1. In the process of nursery development, we have learned that forest villagers want indigenous varieties that grow naturally in the forest for their nurseries unlike timber that is always promoted for plantation. The forest villagers believe that plantations of more indigenous variety can restore the degraded forest patches and eventually reduce the human-animal conflict.  2. We have found that the youth group in the villages are very enthusiastic about computer education.  3. We also learned that cluster farming can have a huge impact on the income of the families.     9.",
        "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? 1. We are raising only indigenous varieties in our nurseries. There is no plan for timber plantation. 2. We have incorporated computer learning in all 7 centers. All centers will start with one desktop each this year. 3. The huge production of mustard and jute has made us think of exploring the scope of value addition and marketing initiatives. We have already started talking to the clusters on the marketing efforts.   10.",
        "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?

Objective 1 Objective Strengthening social security delivery system and increasing access to benefits and entitlements    7.1.b. Objective 1 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  The Oak Project: As part of our ongoing efforts to create a social registry for migrant workers, our Jan Saathis registered 1,30,859 migrant workers across sources and destinations on the Jan Saathi mobile application during the project period, out of which 70906 women have been registered on the portal. These workers were also provided with pre-departure and post-arrival training sessions. In these sessions, the workers are informed about their rights and the mechanisms in place to safeguard them. The workers are also informed about the various entitlements that they can access at the destination and source they are currently present.   Social status of families registered in West Bengal   The team has been successful in facilitating 78,153 scheme applications for various households. Out of these, till May 2022, 70,201 applications have converted to benefits of which 36,154 are for women-led households. The application-to-benefit conversion ratio is (~89%) which is similar to what was envisaged at the start of the program.  Overall MRC Progress: In the MRC program, running across 13 states, we have currently reached out to 28,22,497 households since October 2020, they have been registered with the Migrants Resilience Collaborative. Aligned with our strategy to register women as primary respondents for the households, 40% of households have a woman as the primary respondent in May 2022. Our Jan Saathis uses the mobile application to check eligible schemes for registered migrant workers and facilitate applications for such schemes. The Jan Saathis also tracks the delivery of benefits for each application they help submit. The major schemes that we focused on in West Bengal were Lakshmi Bhandar, Krishak Bandhu, old age pension, widow pension, disability pension, Bina Mulya Samajik Suraksha Yojana, BOCW, PMSBY, E-shram, BMSSY and Swasthya Sathi.  Our team was able to facilitate and implement all the above-mentioned activities smoothly through the constant support of the district labor officials.   Oak Progress Report.    3 Till May 22, 26.6 lakh scheme applications were facilitated and 22.20 lakh benefits were received in the MRC program, working across 13 states The focus in many states was in ensuring the filing of applications for the community instead of only registering them. In May 2022, the major schemes under which applications were filed include EShram, PMSY , Ayushman Bharat, BoCW cards, PM Kisan Saman Nidhi, PM Awas Yojana, MGNREGA and work related to ration.      7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. 1. Due to the second wave of Covid19, our operations were halted from April 21- June 21. 2. Political interference at the local level affects operation. Despite securing support from Gram Pradhan, the team often faces resistance from other members of the same political party. 3. The MRC during the initial days did not receive support from the community. They believed that we had come from NRC and harassed our team members.   4. Government does not accept offline application forms. The only medium to submit the applications is through Duare Sarkar camps. Currently, there are no mechanisms for submitting the applications for state-specific schemes online, so the team has to wait for duare Sarkar camps to happen in order to submit the application form. This makes availing the entitlement lengthy.    7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective Enabling responsible recruitment    7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  The Oak Project: In West Bengal, the team has been getting access to new construction sites under Mission BOCW. Mission BOCW has been largely successful and we have further streamlined implementation support on sites to ensure workers can access social security support, keeping the effect of on-site operations to a minimum. The team in Kolkata engages in 2 sites that come under and till now, 1087 applications have been submitted for 355 unique workers and 751 benefits were delivered for 348 unique workers at construction sites. Overall MRC Progress: In the last year, the team has focused on Mission BOCW which is a coordinated effort with the government, private sector, and civil society to help migrant construction workers and their familys tide over the crisis. Through this campaign, we aim to register one million construction workers by December'22 in 100 cities and districts of 12 states of India.  Oak Progress Report.    4 The targeted outcome this year was to get labor responsibly recruited to Industries but as we proceeded, we understood that to responsibly recruit labor we need to first initiate partnerships with the industry to gain access to sites. Hence, we started to focus on Mission BOCW as a stepping stone towards the larger goal of responsible recruitment which will be an eventual outcome of the same.  We are currently engaging with 11 industry partners (employers) across the textile and construction sectors. These include names Such as BCI, CREDAI, BCI, HDFC, Godrej and Tata Realty. In Partnership with HDFC capital, we are in the process of launching an initiative aimed at recognizing and rewarding the industrys best practices, which in turn will ensure proactive engagement of real estate companies in providing social security for the construction workers compliance at the sites under HDFC capital. An LOI has been signed with the CREDAI National (The prime industry body of construction developers), through which they will help with onboarding developers onto the Mission BOCW-where social security entitlements will be facilitated on-site at all MRC destination cities.      7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. 1. Gaining access to sites has been a major challenge.  2. Even after receiving permission for the sites, the onsite managers create hindrance in registering the workers for BOCW. 3. Lack of proper documents (Aadhaar card, bank details etc.)  with the workers at construction sites limits our ability to facilitate social security entitlements. 4. Besides, the presence of promoters of real estate companies/ site managers often hinders interaction of Jan Saathis with the workers and the ability of the workers to share their problems freely. 5. The onsite managers expect that the scheme's benefits should be given immediately to the laborers, which is not possible as the delivery is determined by the processes at the Labor and other relevant departments. 6. BOCW and many major schemes are not applicable for inter-state migrant workers in West Bengal. A number of workers in Kolkata, especially in the construction sector, are inter-state migrants which could not be benefited due to the limitations.     7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective Enabling workers awareness and access to protective services    7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress.  Oak Progress Report.    5 What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  The Oak Project: In the last year, 797 calls were received on the helpline and across all districts, a total of 97 cases were registered in the supported districts and 41 cases have been resolved till now. The team has received 4 cases of accidents at the workplace, 1 case of minimum wages, 1 case of forced labour, 91 cases of non-payment of wages. The team has currently recovered the wage of around Rs 2,34,492. The remaining cases lack evidence and thats why they are not closed yet. The team is continuously working on promoting helpline services in the communities and labor nakas (labor hubs).  We have held awareness sessions for 39,822 workers in the workplace about their rights and entitlements through pre-departure and post-arrival training. Our target was 80,000 but due to gaining late access to sites as covid 2nd wave was then prevalent, we will cover the balance 40,000 workers in year 2 and 3.  Overall MRC Progress: In the MRC program, running across 13 states, 34,665 calls have been received on the helpline since October 2020, in which 6035 cases have been registered. 1127 cases were received from the field team and 4,908 were received through Helpline till May 22. Out of the total cases received till October,3,256 cases have been closed after adequate interventions. Different strategies have been adopted to popularize the helpline. Besides IEC materials, wall paintings have been used an innovative strategy so that the workers get to know about the helpline. The helpline has received calls from over 425 districts across the country. We have hired lawyers who are helping our team and stakeholders in implementing and imbibe SOPs, enabling and capacitating the system towards transformation- Exposure to labour departments, community volunteer building relationships and sensitization of field and central teams. We have a dedicated lawyer in each state.        7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. 1. Collecting evidence from the labor  for the cases to proceed with them legally has been a challenge, as the labor is not fully aware of how to collect proper evidence and this causes obstacles in solving the cases.  2. Even though the workers are fully aware and all the evidence is in place , the workers do not want to fight against the contractor as they are scared that they might not find work in the future.    8.",

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  In Output 1, significant progress has been achieved. Various studies, including an Ethnographic Survey of 800 households, PVCA, and Action research, have completed the needs assessment. Findings indicate that nearly 50 % of tribal households lack tribal identity cards, hindering their access to government policies. The project aided 300 beneficiaries in obtaining caste certificates and supported 144 beneficiaries in accessing government schemes. PVCA using PRA tools was accomplished in 8 villages, offering insights into resources, hazard exposure, vulnerability, and coping capacity. The Action research guided the project timeline and methods, including multi-hazard mapping, website creation, and PVCA framework. Land Use and Land Cover mapping using Remote Sensing and GIS analysis and communication of weather forecasts and crop advisories through Information Hubs are in progress to assist the farmers. Knowledge was shared via the new project website (https://soundofsilencesundarban.com/). Output 2 involves forming 69 WSHGs and 16 Youths' Groups, involving 800 households and 215 young individuals. Capacity training was completed in all 8 villages for 380 participants. Initiatives include Information Hubs for education, employment, and NRM-based vocations. Ongoing efforts ensure weather forecasts and hazard warnings in Bengali. Output 3 showcases accomplishments. LRRM held health camps for 71 women in Kultali, with more planned by DRCSC in other areas. Both organizations have also appealed to the respective Block Development Offices (BDOs) for organizing vaccination drives. Football equipment was distributed to 8 youths groups, along with plans for exercise and training under sought trainers.   7.c. Challenges and obstacles.  We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Some challenges occurred where adjustments had to be made and the following learnings have been obtained:  Setting up field offices in the blocks of Kakdwip, Sandeshkhali I and Kultali, where none existed, was an ordeal owing to the lack of availability of suitable office spaces with basic amenities such as washrooms, drinking water and electricity.  Delays in obtaining the necessary permission from local government offices for the implementation of project activities in the selected villages and blocks.  Oak Progress Report.    3  Interference and obstruction by local political leaders in the recruitment of community mobilizers. Negotiating with these political functionaries and ensuring no such barriers in future required time, patience and tact.  Rapport-building with local communities is a time-consuming process. The project team decided against an aggressive approach, giving the communities adequate time and information about project objectives to help them decide if they would participate in the project, and cooperating with them to help dispel any misgivings or doubts they may have harbored. The upcoming Panchayat election has slowed the pace of work in the villages, as project activities had to be delayed upon the advice of local government officials.     8.",

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  During the grant period 27 nos. of Farmers Groups including 405 members (mainly women) have formed through PRA/PVCA exercises. Representation is there from poor and vulnerable section of society and farmers from various caste, religion, age and disability. Group members are regularly attending meetings, identifying issues, maintaining group registers, make savings, discuss various issues etc. Participation from each group members (mainly women) is ensured and they are very much interested to give time and share their learning to dissolve issue among the members. Orientation meetings are arranged to generate awareness among the poor and vulnerable people for accessing various developmental provisions prescribed in different government schemes. Through this initiative almost every member are availing at least one scheme from state govt. It is very helpful for the farmers to get training (cultivation of different crops like potato, paddy, sesame, pulses etc.) & inputs (paddy seeds, neem oil etc.) from ADA which boosts their interest and they are cultivating those crops in the kharif season with sustainable agriculture practices. The farmers are using Climate resilient agricultural practices (sorjan technique, integrated farming system, vermi-pit, fish rearing, small livestock rearing (hen, duck, goat etc.) to cope up with vagaries and challenges of climate change. Community Seed Banks are established in the project area towards conservation of salt-tolerant seeds for future. They are getting diversified organic nutritious vegetable through Nutrition garden regularly which assured nutrition to the small and marginal farming families in the targeted villages. They protect vulnerable coast line through plantation of 10000 saplings of mangroves in the river bank sites (3 ha) as identified by respective persons including GP members, community members etc. Mangrove nursery is also established with 20000 seeds. Protection groups are formed with the community people to monitor and protect the mangrove saplings. After getting training community members are hervesting rain water in the pond and cultivating mixed cops in dry season and developed pond bank management model including plantation in embankment, small livestock rearing over the pond etc.  Selected farmers have Small livestock rearing (chicks, duck & goat) along with their shelter management is becoming a promising alternative livelihood option among the community people in the project areas.

According to Nirman Sahayak (Engineer of Gram Panchayat), though they are interested in upliftment of climate adaptive models in the villages through various developmental activities, but due to govt. budget constraint they cant implement those activities at field level. At the initial stage of group forming, DRCSC staff had to deal with some political disturbances. With time, these disturbances were gradually decreasing.    7.2.a.

This is done to establish a network between the selected grass-root organisations working in Sundarbans and enhance each others capacity in the area of climate change adaptation. In addition advance training on climate change, poverty & sustainable livelihood has been done with follow up sessions. Selected farmers who participated in the training get exposure visit in other villages where DRCSCs intervention is going on. Handholding training on pest control measures, bio-manure preparation, seed preservation techniques etc. are provided to the farmers. It is observed that most of the farmers are developed their skills & knowledge on these aspects and are practicing climate resilient agriculture in their respective places. Trainings are also provided on Gender sensitization & concept building, Community-led Advocacy, Child safeguarding policy etc. The project staffs and community members get oriented on the issues and prepare plan of action for sensitizing more number of villagers in the respective area.

        "Progress Against Objectives": "Progress Against Objectives Under each expected project objective, briefly explain your progress in reaching the objective and its results, and discuss any changes you propose to the project goals or objectives with the PO.  7.1.a. Objective 1 To empower communities through access to information and entitlements with the help of the SEWA Shakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] in Jharkhand and West Bengal   7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments The experience of SEWA and similar organizations demonstrate that workers in the informal economy, especially women, benefit from organising themselves to identify their status as workers and demand better working conditions and fair wages. Organizing enables an otherwise scattered labour force to negotiate with employers and decision-makers from the government. It is to this end that SEWA works with women in the informal economy to improve women and girls agency and visibility, autonomy and secure their socio-economic rights. The programme across two states of Jharkhand and West Bengal works to address the systematic issues affecting women and girls and to advance the rights of these women as informal women workers under the gamut of the unorganised sector. Throughout the past fifteen months, the perils of COVID-19 continued to present multiple challenges to our members, through the second lockdown imposed in the months of April-May 2021, followed by the third wave of COVID inflicted field restrictions in January-February 2022. For West Bengal, this situation was also politically charged in the state with the Legislative Assembly election throughout March and April 2021, which led to a fairly slow start to programme activities as per the Workplan. In Bengal, the situation was aggravated by another challenge: the floods in Malda. Almost 15000 community members in Malda faced flooding during the rainy season. Meanwhile, in Jharkhand, the situation was aggravated due to a lack of proper channels of communication, which got lost due to the sufficient infrastructure available for our members. Throughout the year, the grassroots leaders and organisers in both states have worked dedicatedly towards increasing engagements resulting in outreach: Trade West Bengal Jharkhand Beedi workers 21000   Domestic workers 4000 1600 Agriculture   3907 Construction   1400 Others   587 Taking the membership base across both states to 32494, increasing the membership by 20% in year 1 of the current grant.  Through the experience of engaging with informal women workers, grassroots leadership has emerged at the CORE for any programme development or strengthening of the SEWA movement for SEWA Bharat.   Aagewans (SEWA grassroots women leaders) are the elected leaders in the SEWA movement. They are the face of SEWA. The Program aims to increase the bargaining power of these grassroots leaders by developing their capacities to provide leadership in their communities and understand issues surrounding the women in the informal economy be it in trade, occupation, rights and access. Due to their local presence, Agewans are often approached by SEWA members and the larger community to help them register for government schemes or benefits, as well as to negotiate wages and issues with employers. Aagewans play a vital role in the SEWA movement as they are the bridge between the Government, contractors of work and all the women working in the informal economy to ensure the last-mile delivery of services and support to them. Therefore,  facilitating their capacity building and knowledge enhancement around SEWA s work is our foremost priority.  The team in West Bengal focused the interventions on activating aagevans towards an action-oriented approach and emphasised the need to reach out to more women workers. Whilst in Jharkhand, which is relatively a newer intervention area, the focus is to further strengthen the collectivisation process led by the aagevans so that they can lead the trade-specific advocacy and government liaisoning.   Capacity Building of Agewans through Agewan Vikas Training Throughout the year from March 2021 onwards, the Agewan received various training and knowledge building sessions. In Jharkhand, two batches covering  40 Agewan completed their Agewan Vikas Program training course which focused on the following modules (1) SEWA Ideology (2) Importance of Union & Trade organising (3) Identifying issues and taking community issues (4) Trade committee.  Across West Bengal, the training(s) was conducted to equip 106 agewans with the knowledge and skills required to become efficient leaders at the community level.  For the Bengal team, post the training the agewans from every block prepared a three-month plan in which they included linkages with government schemes like Swasthya Sathi, Ration Adhaar link, preparing a rate chart for domestic workers etc. This made the process of evaluating the growth of aagevans across the year more thorough.  Various inputs given to the aagevans throughout the year, in the form of training(s), sessions or discussions have led to not only increased awareness of aagevans among the community members but resulted in several actions being taken by aagevans that manifested their leadership qualities.

They are also gradually leading the SEWA meetings held in their localities, moderating the sessions to the best of their ability. They also assist in the development of the strategy for monthly community and trade events in their respective locations. The agewans are facilitating social security linkages in collaboration with the SEWA Shakti Kendra linkages such as E-Shram portal registration, conducting Mahila Arogya Meetings and linking communities with public health services. In West Bengal,  through the above -mentioned training in Berhampore, 4 agewans have taken up the responsibility to conduct unit meetin gs (a unit is a cluster of 20 -30 local women coming together for a common purpose)  and mobilize the domestic workers who are coming from the outskirts of the city to fix their rates. Shampa ben and Deepali ben, two agewans (domestic workers) got a chance to take part in the SEWA National level domestic workers workshop in November 2021 where they highlighted their issues on the National platform. This knowledge helps them to mobilize others and talk about their demands with their employers. The domestic wo rkers in Bengal were able to visit the labour department to enrol themselves under Samajik Suraksha Yojana (a social security scheme of the W Bengal government). This was important as otherwise they would not have any Social Security as the state does not recognise the Domestic Workers as workers as yet. The Labour Commissioner agreed and committed to helping them with the enrollment. In Jharkhand, the Agewans are representing their trade memorandum to MPs and participating in the process of memorandum su bmission. In the years 2021 and 2022, they submitted the advocacy points regarding ILO Convention 189 (Provisioned work rights of domestic workers: Decent wage, favourable workplace, fixed work hours, 4 weekly holidays in a month, no discrimination at the workplace, wage on time)   for developing more inclusive policies for domestic workers in the country under the guidance of the National Domestic Workers platform. This has garnered the recognition of agewans among key community leaders such as the Municipa l Councillor. Through the social security sessions, the Agewans now understand the importance of registration of members under the Labour Board according to their trade and have been continuously engaging with them to ensure all their area members are gett ing registered under the BoCW Board, Unorganised Workers Board and the E-Shram Portal. Digital Recognition: Many Agewan represented themselves on many digital platforms in the year 2021 by video documentation and online session participation, discussing th eir work and their journey as Agewan in their neighbourhood as well as at their workplace, and highlighting the conversation on worker rights.   Aagevan led meetings at the community level, SEWA Bharat, in West Bengal, has been organising women through uni t meetings and giving them a platform where they can come together and discuss their community -specific issues and address them jointly. A total of 473 meetings were conducted by 24 agewans across Murshidabad and Malda reaching up to more than 10000 members. The various topics on which meetings were conducted included Government schemes like SSY , Lakhir Bhandar, Duare Sarkar, E-shram card and community level issues including sanitation, safety etc. Through these meetings, it is ensured that women from the community have access to information on schemes and services which otherwise they would not be aware of and therefore would not be able to avail of the benefits covered under the schemes. Being members of the marginalised group, women are often exploited in the name of scheme linkages and become victims of fraud. Through these meetings, they are well informed about the schemes which prevent them from falling into any trap. Through the meetings community members have collectively taken up action to protest against low wages and held   meetings with Mahajans to put forward their demands, To ensure good health and hygiene within the community signature campaign was held at Suti (block in Raghunathganj) and a letter was submitted to panchayat in demand of improving drainage to which the panchayat responded and acted upon. These meetings also enable women to come out of their confined zones and share their concerns in the meeting. This gives them more courage and confidence to interact and express their views. In Jharkhand, the agewans have started conducting meetings in the community on what they learn from SEWA and that which need to be reached out to the members. as they are leading meetings in the new areas and this is helping SEWA to expand its work and membership in Jharkhand.  A total of 25 such women are regularly undertaking the responsibilities of an Aagevan forward.   Awareness programmes conducted by Agewans: Various awareness sessions and meetings were held on topics like government health structure, balan ced diet, vaccination, awareness regarding COVID -19 safety protocols, and the importance of sanitation and hygiene in everyday life across Malda and Murshidabad. A total of  10 awareness programmes were conducted by agewans in their community, reaching up to more than 500 members across Malda and Murshidabad. The programmes were used as a platform to address the myths and misconceptions related to health practices, and vaccination at the ground level which makes them vulnerable to the diseases but due to the intervention of the agewans through the meetings and awareness sessions, our members have become sensitised and are taking steps to break the myths and misconceptions. Our agewans have successfully referred 6000 members for the first dose of vaccination and 4000 for the second dose of vaccination. In addition to the ongoing concern about health, many sessions and programmes were also centred around the loss of work and the importance of restoring livelihoods. 10 agewans and 3 youth group members mobilized village members in Pathanpara, Lalgola (Block in Murshidabad) and collectively demanded an increase in wages for beedi rolling at the Block level office. The agewans were joined by the other community members and other trade unions such as CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions). In response to their demand wages increased from Rs 155 to Rs 165, for every 1000 bidis. This was also supported by a larger intervention to protect the livelihood of the marginalised, SEWA Bharat facilitated linkage with MGNREGA; a total of 150 members received work through this. In Jharkhand, the result of a public meeting conducted by the domestic workers in Ranchi, wherein they demanded work in Urban and to start Urban MGNREGA in the city as well, was conducted under the National Domestic Workers platform. Members started getting themselves registered under Urban MGNREGA, by the year-end of 2022, Agewan  (Sunita Orain) from Pandra Ranchi reported that along with her more than 10 members have received 90 days of Job under Ranchi Municipal Corporation for sweeping work in Vendor Market.  My Fair Home Campaign by Domestic workers  Berhampore, Murshidabad Increasing fear of transmission among common people and lockdown rules led to the loss of livelihood among domestic workers as most of the employers were not ready to allow domestic workers at their homes and as a result, they were deprived of wages, continued to be a persistent problem even during the second-wave of COVID -19 pandemic. SEWA Bengal initiated the  My Fair Home Campaign in Berhampore, Murshidabad to promote fair wages and get domestic workers back to work through negotiation with the employers. Through the campaign, 5 domestic workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic got back their jobs. Rina Mondal is one of the Domestic workers who took part in the campaign, After the lockdown was imposed due to the emerging second wave of the pandemic she was asked by her employer to not come to work nor was she being paid a minimum wage to support her family duri ng the distressing time. Through the campaign 3 agewans and 2 domestic workers and organisers from SEWA West Bengal collectively approached the employers to support her with her monthly wages at the household level. This led to an achievement where the emp loyers agreed to support them till the lockdown restrictions were lifted post which she joined back to work unconditionally.   Ranchi, Jharkhand Domestic workers have been facilitated in understanding their wages according to their work hours and days. Therefore, a regular meeting with Agewan and the trade committee members has been undertaken to understand how the rate chart should be normally developed by the domestic workers. Therefore a campaign was conducted by the Agewan and Domestic Worker trade group members and trade leaders by conducting focus group discussions in areas from where the domestic workers go to work to different areas. firstly to understand that in current days how domestic workers are getting their work according to their work hours. Through the focus group discussion, SEWA learnt about their household counts, work hours in each household, the amount they receive, number of rooms they take care of, types of service they provide to the household, and distance of workplace area. Now in the next phase, the domestic workers will be facilitated and mobilised to bring the rates to a common rate so that each can do equal work and get an equal rate.    Campaign on MGNREGA:  The Right to Food network observed a 14-day campaign from 15th September to 1st October 2021. As a part of the initiative, agewans of SEWA West Bengal took part in the campaign. In Murshidabad and Malda districts SEWA members conducted poster campaigns and submitted letters to the nodal officer mentioning their demands of get ting work under the MGNREGA scheme thereby letting the voices reach the duty bearers and making them accountable.  Around 250 members received work through this campaign which ensured their Right to livelihood. ---X--- Engagement with Y outh  The inclusion of youth in transforming their communities by organizing them into groups is fundamental for the growth and development of the community as a whole. Years of Engagement with the youth have helped in developing the next generation of leadership at the grassroots who are capable of addressing their community-level issues and advocating for the fulfilment of rights of women involved in the informal economy thereby leading the SEWA movement forward. The training(s) and meetings have provided them with a platform to learn new skills, build upon their knowledge and be aware of their rights and entitlements In Jharkhand, as a part of learning from Bengal, local youth groups have been created to recognise their issues, address them and develop the second SEWA generation. Thus from 2021 SEWA Jharkhand started organising the adolescent girls as well, started conducting informal meetings with them in their area to know them more and to also know what they know about informal work, SEWA as a movement of women workers and the challenges their mothers face to earn a decent work and remain resilient at times of extreme crisis like the pandemic or flood. For them, it was not new to see their mother gathering for meetings, and discussions, under the SEWA banner, so the Adolescent girls were well aware that their mother worked as a domestic worker, construction worker and agriculture worker and they are a member of SEWA and their mothers are organised by SEWA for their trade righteous and issues. so understanding SEWA was not hard for them. During their, meetings they are encouraged to bring us their issues as an adolescent like marriageable age, Sexual and Reproductive health, choice in life, education, skill and employment. Today in both the districts in Jharkhand, Ranchi and Hazaribagh 45 adolescent girls are part of SEWA now and recently by the end of the year 2021 formal meetings were conducted in both the district SEWA office for the orientation of SEWA work and to find opportunities to know how to work with the Adolescent girls in Jharkhand. The girls were started involved in KOBO tool training (Data collection training) where they will work on surveys in future to be conducted by SEWA.    Youth Group meetings and Training While SEWA historically considers itself at the intersection of the labour movement and the womens movement, the expansion of work under the Youth leadership development program has allowed us to deepen our involvement in these movements through the adoption of new praxes, as well as increasing   our integration into work around public health. We do this through expanding our core approach of rights-based mobilising, and building on it through the incorporation of voices and agency of young girls who then join the labour movement and the womens movement as empowered actors, right from the onset. Key activities that the youth girls have engaged in have been consciousness -raising and mobilising for community issues. These have included developing a narrative around issues that young women and girls face regard ing health, autonomy, livelihood, and financial independence. Additionally, the girls have learned how to mobilise peer groups to advocate for changes in their socio-economic conditions e.g. access to COVID and Polio vaccination camps, ensuring police main tained safety during the lockdown and lobbying for access to services and resources as per their due. They leveraged their newly acquired digital fluency to ensure continuous consciousness -raising amongst their peers and within their communities, through the era of social distancing. They further used these new skills to engage with relevant stakeholders on Facebook and Whatsapp groups, and keep the spotlight on their issues, even when COVID threatened to displace them.   In West Bengal, the youth group members conducted meetings on community-level issues that affected the lives of the youth within their community like early marriage, menstruation, hygiene and sanitation. Over the grant period,  36 such meetings have been conducted. They have been involved in  raising awareness about various issues like organising campaigns against child marriage. There are at present 9 active groups comprising 126 members across Murshidabad and Malda working towards transforming their communities through youth-led advocacy.  Since young girls from Murshidabad and Malda are affected by issues of child marriage, sexual harassment, and increasing dropout, it was of primary importance to address the issues by making them aware of their rights. Total 5 training(s) have been organise d in collaboration with other organisations like Praajak and Bhavna network through which 126 youth group members got sensitized on Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012, different aspects of leadership and gender equality. Through the train ing, the youth group members gained knowledge concerning Child rights and developed insights on how gender equality challenges notions of patriarchy and how they can become effective leaders by addressing inequitable gender norms. The training(s)led to",
        "Significant changes": "significant changes which could be observed among  8-10 girls as they would try to speak up at the end of the training sessions and would get more comfortable in expressing their views and opinions with their peers. They would also encourage their peers to come out of their confined zones and chase their dreams. In Ranchi (Jharkhand), as per demand expressed by the youth regarding their rights to safety, a session on legal aspects and rights of Sexual Harassment and violence at the workplace and a knowledge session series have been started. These adolescent girls are the daughters of the SEWA members of Ranchi. They are pursuing their education from 10th to graduation. Thus this year SEWA Bharat has started organising them too to strengthen them and give them an understanding about their mothers working as unorganised workers and what hardship efforts they are putting to run and bear the family members expense.   Providing them with such knowledge will also help in identifying cases among the adolescent as well as older members where they do not share about their work issues whether it is wage discrimination, unfavourable work conditions or violence. These sessions were facilitated by AALI (Association for Advocacy and Legal Initiatives Trust). 31 Adolescent girls are now the 1st batch for this session. These 31 adolescent girls are assigned to share what they learnt from the session with other adolescent girls in their area till the next session. Also, 30 Adolescent Girls from Ranchi and Hazaribagh were part of an online data collection and resume development training, this was to help them for developing resumes in future when they go out in search of jobs.  9 young girls from the tribal areas have been given training on Sohrai painting. This skill would be enhanced to explore earning opportunities from their local art. SEWA Bharat in both states recognised the need of establishing Youth clubs as a key component for the work and strengthening of the greater SEWA movement. Each intervention has assisted adolescent girls in integrating into society, developing stronger relationships with family members and peer groups, and, most importantly, developing and appreciating their voice and, in particular, the agency they have over the   decisions that affect their lives. This has benefited SEWA Bharat's efforts to establish youth work as a solid foundation for activities in the states, as well as to improve relationships with community members. As a result, our actions last longer and have a higher impact. ---X--- Capacity Building of staff Capacity building of local team members is essential to ensure the sustainable impact of any intervention. Whether it is via their contribution to constantly readapt program learnings into the program design, or their support in further building capacities of aagewans, it is the local teams that ultimately are responsible for the success of an intervention.  Various training(s) have been given to the team throughout the year for the team:  Panchyati Raj system  Wage and Social security code by the Joint labour commissioner  Labour rights and entitlements by the Right to Food network  The importance of Gram Sabha by the SEWA National Council  C- 190 Violence in the world of Work  E- Shram portal training  Understanding on New labour codes  Gender, poverty & Unemployment   Leadership Development  Gender, decent work & Social Protection  Unorganised workers & Labour Issues  Leadership Development and Trade Union leader, by V .V . Giri Training Institute, facilitated by the SEWA National Council  For staff capacity building, the staff also participated in many virtual training sessions, like for building knowledge of the Sangathan perspective. International Training course Economic & Social Protection Course '' These courses have helped the sta ff to understand the SEWAs work more for the members and their protection on trade, work, wage & social protection.  Through the training(s) and sessions, the staff were being capacitated with the knowledge and skills required for effective intervention at the field level. Evident changes were visible among the staff members as they became more informed on the rights and entitlements of the workers employed in the unorganized sector, and learnt about the wages and security code which plays an important part in the empowerment of workers and ensuring their social security. Knowledge about the Panchayat structure is fundamental in ensuring access to schemes and services at the village level. Further, the information received was communicated to the members th rough aagevan meetings which helped in facilitating advocacy at the Block and District level as they became conscious of their rights. For instance, In West Bengal, after knowing about the Janani Suraksha Yojna through the Right to Food Network training, 3 members received financial benefits through the scheme. Staff are also undertaking regular visits to make the District level violence committee functional. Annual Planning and Review Sessions This year the field teams across both states actively took the need for having annual work plans as utmost priority. Beginning of each year in both 2021 and 2022, the teams prepared annual work plans and presented the same to their colleagues, which in turn contributed to the development of the larger workplan for the  programmes. The team, along with support from the Central team members also supported the team by   undertaking sessions for the development of monitoring tools for different programmes being implemented in the states.  Workshop and sessions aimed at review, as well as for the development of the Theory of Change document, which has been crucial for understanding the work being done, as well as linking the same results to the larger impact aimed through the programme.  Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning The focus through this period has been on the development of aagevans, who have started owning the process and regularly maintain field note diaries to note their work, achievements and challenges. This becomes a repository to build evidence of the aagevan capacity, issues and challenges met at the field level and the responses of the stakeholders in the local ecosystem. Along with this, a key focus is on maintaining Monthly Progress Reports (MPR) by the state team, which capture all programmes and projects being done in the state. These reports act as monthly trackers for all ongoing programmes in the state and add key inputs to the larger state development plan Monitoring visits by the Programme Coordinator, and other programme and project coordinators, to help support state teams with various inputs needed for the functioning of the programmes, as well as the visits directed towards identifying the needs for state development and prioritisation. These include visits from different verticals across SEWA Bharat such as Communications, Research and other teams to help support the state teams with capacity building with these skills needed towards the strengthening of the state. This allows for teams to continue with regular fieldwork while also understanding the larger motive behind doing the activities. Input sessions with Senior leadership have also been a key input toward programme strengthening and state development. Systematized and regular maintenance of monitoring mechanisms and means of verifications allowed for efficient tracking of work:  Maintaining Minutes of meetings  Excel sheets and Google Drives to maintain the SSK data  Reporting of case studies  Reflection sessions All of these contribute to a holistic approach toward state development and building different aspects needed for autonomy.     7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls Following the announcement of the second lockdown, the team shifted quickly to online modes of communication, meetings, and other activities. Although the staff was acclimated to online sessions, the uptake was accompanied by the time required to adjust. SEWA believes that a key component in the work aimed at aagevan development is the component of exposure visits, which could not be undertaken in both states due to lockdown restrictions, and this added to aagevans taking time in owning the entire process of becoming change agents for the community, and fully transforming into their leadership roles. Overall, we noted a slowdown in activities, which we believe is related to mental fatigue among the staff as a result of stagnant work and delayed processes, which has resulted in a lack of enthusiasm and interest in the work, particularly with field-level operations, which are becoming more difficult due to continued COVID restrictions and are exposing the underlying vulnerabilities among our members. This disrupts a grassroots people-based organisation, slowing down the program's progress.   As a result, such situations are handled with a thorough engagement with the desired outcome and reflection sessions, which allow teams to revisit the objectives of engaging in activities that could become monotonous. For Bengal, the shortfall is due to the ongoing deterioration of beedi workers' conditions, the adoption of the labour code, and other factors that have demotivated beedi workers and aagevans. As this appears to be a setback for years of advocacy and interaction with our members, who are now suffering as a result of policy changes and a decline in beedi work in the country. Jharkhand observed that, despite having digital tools offered to Aagevan, frequent monitoring of tool use becomes difficult, and its maintenance has become an additional duty, aggravated due to a lack of infrastructure and public resources.     7.2.a. Objective 2 To empower communities through access to information and entitlements with the help of the SEWA Shakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] in Jharkhand and West Bengal   7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments SEWA operates empowerment centres known as SEW A Shakti Kendras in all districts across the two states. SEWA's presence and operations in communities are anchored on the SSKs. They connect community people with government programmes and schemes related to microfinance, health, job, and skill development opportunities, and they provide resources, support, and information to women for their economic and social growth. The SSK is also important as a last-mile delivery mechanism for social security and welfare systems, supporting women and their families in accessing them. These centres, which are staffed by a woman from the local community, give assurance and assistance to help women negotiate the application processes and receive public welfare benefits. SEWA Shakti Kendra acts as a bridge between the government and the community members. Through the SSK community members became aware not only of their rights but also of the way to access them. At present, through the programme, the states have developed around 8 SSKs under the OAK programme, overall 9 SSKs at present supported through various programmes. The inputs given have bolstered the SSK in ensuring  An increased outreach, covering wider schemes and ensuring maximum benefits are received through the Kendras, while also including the expansion of services by catering to the community needs through camps, aagevan mobilisation, and door-to-door visits  Inputs towards the development of staff capacity on handling multiple aspects attached to the SSK, along with developing the SSK In-charge by identifying young leaders in the community.  Working towards stronger connections with stakeholders, and relevant government departments.  Regularised and centralised database management system. The major accomplishment has been to nudge the SEWA Shakti Kendras towards sustainability and ensuring by the end of the grant Year 1, 60-65% growth across all aspects mentioned above.   Increasing access to Social security schemes through strengthening  SSKs   In West Bengal, over the grant period, 26518 linkages have been facilitated with various social security and welfare schemes through the SSKs across Murshidabad and Malda. The SSKs played a significant role in providing information and enabling access to government schemes and services. Out of the total linkages carried out 6790 linkages have been initiated by the agewans, 2500 by the youths and 17228 by Organisers and SSK-in charge thereby ensuring fulfilment of rights and entitlements of the beneficiaries by facilitating their access to welfar e schemes which is essential in reducing their vulnerabilities and ensuring better standards of living. The impact of the SEWA Shakti Kendras can truly be understood through the instances of benefits received by the members and their families: Bandana Haldar, who is from a small village in Murshidabad's Lalgola block, is a beedi roller; her husband is a construction worker, and she has two daughters in school. Due to the pandemic-induced threats of wage loss, the family was finding it difficult to spend on their children's education. At this point, she accessed the SSK and learned about the scholarship facility available under the SSY programme. She had previously been affiliated with the SSY scheme, which made applying for the scholarship easier. Her eldest  daughter Mandira received the scholarship amount after successfully filling out and submitting the form with the assistance of the SEWA organisers. She is now able to continue her studies. Johra Khatun is a beneficiary of the state-run Swasthya sathi scheme which is a health insurance scheme, she was linked with the scheme in the year 2021. Her husband s entire treatment for the hydrocele operation was covered under the scheme.   In Jharkhand, by linking our members with social security schemes that may cover their trade-related issues, over 2500 linkages have been facilitated with various social security and welfare schemes across Ranchi and Hazaribagh. The members are connected to Building and other Construction workers board, Unorganised Workers Board, supported through seed linkage for agriculture worker members and Health scheme linkage. More than 1600 forms were received for the BOCW application but after documentation verification, only 984 forms were filled and submitted and 849 were accepted by the Labour office (Labour office only accepts those forms who have proper Aadhar card detail, residential of Ranchi zone, proper bank details without any IFSC issue if this is fulfilled the forms are accepted ) after the verification and out of it 411 eligible applicants (Who have already received one benefit but have not submitted the bills of purchasing tools and safety kit are not allowed to get the further benefits, not all are eligible for Maternity fund benefit, it is applicable only up to, 1st & 2nd Child, not all are eligible for their children who can avail the scholarship form)filled their benefit form under BoCW and 126 have received their benefit of Safety kit and tool kit scheme.  Apart from BOCW other trades like domestic workers, home-based workers, agriculture workers, forest workers, etc can also get themselves enrolled under the Unorganised workers' board, thus 237 members enrolled themselves this year.    Training(s) and Inputs Many sessions conducted for awareness of scheme and benefits for linking the members and mainly emphasising understanding the importance of each scheme has been crucial, and so far in the last year the members were connected to several schemes like BOCW, Unorganised workers board, Renewal of BOCW, Caste Income residential, PAN Card, Sukanya Samridhi Yojna, Ayushman Card, Agriculture seed linkages, Bank accounts related work and facilitating in other works like online and offline form filling.  Training and Capacity Building of staff: Over the years, multiple kinds of training(s) have been identified which are crucial for the staff    Orientation - a deeper and in-depth understanding of the essence of having SSKs as physical structures within the community, and how they play a vital role in bolstering the SEWA Sangathan  Needs assessment and Engagement of the community - imperative to understand and develop the ability to identify members' issues  Digital Literacy  Engagement with government departments - this allows for faster results to be extracted.   Digital Upgradation and Real-time Data generation The continual upgrade in governance processes, which are now being updated to include digital technologies, requires SSKs to modernise themselves with digital technology. To standardise the processes, the SSK has been supported with adequate infrastructures, such as a computer system or a laptop, along with internet connectivity. With a system at the centre, the SSK's process and data management have become more methodical. For smooth operation, the team receives continual digital capacity building. With increasing distances between communities and governance centres, SSKs serve a crucial role in connecting community members with various government departments.  Coordination, monitoring and supervision- Using WhatsApp and phone calls, both state teams have been in touch with one another to keep abreast with work progress, troubleshoot when hurdles are encountered in the field as well as share positive stories of impact.  Data entry and online form filling- The primary use of technology has been in the data entry and reporting process  both for internal reporting as well as in the process of applying for various social security schemes in various government departments. This had allowed for the creation of databases which can generate data needed for furthering any social security agenda with relevant stakeholders, and allows for SEWAS internal monitoring structures to be streamlined. The same has been attached to the report.   SSK acts as a safe space for community women  Apart from providing information and assistance related to Government schemes and services, community women also access the SSK to share their everyday problems and seek support in resolving issues at the individual and community level. Each centre thus serves as the neighbourhood hub where the community members feel free to drop in and seek clarity on a range of issues. The SSKs also engage with youth in the area and promote youth groups or Yuva mandals that become active as community-based organisations in the area. They take up issues of hygiene and cleanliness in the area and assist the SSK in conducting various activities. They also support girls education, educate and mobilize against early marriages and work for gender equality in general. Most importantly, they become stakeholders in the SSK and are trained to ensure the sustainability of the SSK.   Facilitating access to schemes and services through Home visits Due to the pandemic, there were restrictions on group meetings, hence one to one engagement was given more priority. The Aagewans were assigned the responsibility to reach at least 15 to 20 members per day either through phone calls or door-to-door visits. Health-related guidelines and videos were shared through the WhatsApp group.  The agewans played an active role in their community during the time of crisis by identifying families who need ration, registering members for vaccination and sensitizing community members on COVID-19 safety protocols.   Development of IEC materials: SEWA published a small booklet on MGNREGA to create awareness about the ACT. Through this booklet, women can demand their actual rights to get the food amount from the public distribution system. Such materials act as collaterals for information dissemination, which entail compiling all relevant details succinctly and interactively which is easy to grasp by the larger community.   Activities are done through SSK Social Security Camps in West Bengal:  Through Social security camps, community members are provided with necessary information on specific government schemes and assisted with linkages. Through these camps, it is being ensured that an increasing number of members can be linked with the social security schemes run by the state or central government which can contribute to their well being in the long run.  E-shram card During the grant period,18 camps were conducted across Malda and Murshidabad on the E-shram card which is an initiative by the Government of India which aims to create a database of unorganised workers. A total of 3837 members were registered on the portal through the camp. Samajik Suraksha Yojna (SSY)  2 camps were organized on SSY which is a state-run scheme to integrate the different schemes and to offer uniform benefits to all unorganised workmen to help them face every exigency of life. The scheme has recently been upgraded to Bina Mulay Samajik Suraksha Yojna (BMSY) and its registration is expected to begin this year.  150 members who were already linked with the SSY scheme were assisted through the camp in updating their existing forms. Fever Testing Camp in collaboration with Health Department As the cases of COVId-19 peaked during the second wave of the pandemic, a fever testing camp was held where frontline workers including ASHA and ANM were present. 23 members of the community got tested through this camp.   Government Liaisoning for linkages in Jharkhand: Members visited the Kendras for various linkages such as caste certificates, income-related documents, and residential and PAN Card, but they were referred to Pragya Kendra, a total of 51 services were facilitated by the SSK. Under the Anganwadi Centre in Hazaribagh, a total of 121 forms were filled for Sukanya Samridhi Yojna, which are still under process. The SSK team ensure regular follow-ups with the Anganwadi Supervisor for each case. More than 80 members are linked with the Ayushman Card linkage campaign in Hazaribagh and 68 members were facilitated in bank account work by SSK. And more than 90 members were facilitated in filling out online & Offline forms. The agriculture workers with several 297 were linked with Block/ATMA/PACS for seed linkage during Kharif & Rabbi season.  By the end of 2021 from November to December, in both the districts again a registration campaign was conducted on E-Shram Portal registration and more than 1000 from both the districts.    Impact  The SSKs not only bridge the gap between the grassroots and governance centres but also encourages the community members to participate in the governance. The centres  also hold continuous community meetings where the members come together and discuss their issues and explore ways to solve them. Along with these meetings, there are various kinds of training to happen at these centres. There are financial literacy training, entrepreneurship development training, digital literacy training, empowerment training and workshops educating the members about health, healthy lifestyle and hygiene. It is because of the SSKs   that the centres of governance are accountable and the com munity members are voicing their needs. The training, workshop, and awareness campaigns by the SSK centres have empowered the women with the knowledge of various governance schemes, and skills and boosted confidence throughout the whole process.   Teleconsultation - COVID relief support During the wake of the second wave of COVID-19, healthcare access became difficult due to the overburdened healthcare infrastructure. A teleconsultation model was implemented which aimed to connect women in the field with trained medical experts. In this model, the role of aagevan was seen as essential as it is only because of her presence that the community members trusted unknown doctors with personal, medical information, especially given the current socio-political climate. Through this model,  across the two states, 59 aagevans were strengthened as Master Trainers for dissemination of information in their respective communities, resulting in 13,723 awareness calls being made by community members, to a team of 7 active doctors available.   A dashboard which was updated on daily basis was monitored by a central health team created, led by Susan ben (National Health Coordinator, SEWA)   Working in collaboration with Right to Food Network to secure the fundamental rights of life-food and work SEWA in West Bengal collaborated with the Right to  Food Network to advocate the aspects of Right to Food and other government schemes that are directly or indirectly related to ensuring food security. One Organiser from Murshidabad is now being given the responsibility to work with the network activity to  ensure food security is ensured to the most vulnerable group. As a part of the campaign, help desks were also being set up from where community members can get information related to schemes and services provided by the government. They have also surveyed  to analyse the impact of COVID -19 on the most vulnerable section, the findings of which will be used for advocacy at the state and national levels. Through the network activities, members' access to food security is being ensured.   VLCPC Strengthening  The role of VLCPC is fundamental in making duty bearers accountable for the protection of child rights and addressing issues of child rights violations. As the VLCPC meetings could not be held regularly due to the pandemic, the other hand, the child rights  violation cases were also rising. At this point, agewans and organisers in West Bengal intervened and approached the committee to regularize VLCPC meetings to sensitize the community members to prevent/ reduce the early marriage because during the pandemic early marriage rate was high in West Bengal. 15 meetings were held where discussions centred around early marriage, increasing dropout rate among girls and action plans were formulated to address the issues.   Capacity Building towards inclusive centres The most important strengths of these SSKs are the human resources personnel that are responsible for the functioning of the SSKs. Every SSK consists of a team of SSK in-charge, Field Mobilizer, Supervisor and Aagewans. The SSKs which are close to each other share their supervisor. With a strong monthly reporting system which helps the SSK to track their linkages in place, SSKs can function smoothly. The SSKs have a grievance redressal mechanism through which the members can solve their grievances if any. A continuously developing and evolving database of all the local, state and central government programmes through which the community members could be linked helps the SSK teams to support the community members better. This developing database gives information about the programme, eligibility, required documents, and the application process too. This keeps the SSKs informed about the   developments in government policies and programmes through which they could link the community members. Developing Youth champions through SSKs The SSK has also evolved as space and medium for nurturing local communities. A recent initiative by the SSK team has been on building the capacity of the daughters of SEWA's members. They have been trained to expand the development work in their communities, and have played the role of building trust among their community members towards the services offered by SSKs.     7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls The major challenge both states witnessed was an overall priority shift across the social security sphere in India due to the ongoing COVID pandemic was towards Health, and every other scheme was halted either due to the closing of government offices, or the importance of Health benefits, which led to a major adaptation needed towards centring activities in sync with the Health priority.  This is accompanied by challenges faced by the SSK setup due to external factors, such as:   Repeated transfer of government officials at block/district level Along with internal challenges, like:  Difficulty in identifying trained staff from the grassroots, with a certain desirable skillset needed for understanding the needs and operations for the SSK and the larger social security ambit in India  Data entry and monitoring are hindered by infrastructure challenges, and a lack of availability of resources, which led to many delays in real-time data generation. For West Bengal,  Social security schemes like SSY could not be accessed for a specific period as the portal was under repair, which led to a hurried and hasty application process, leading to many not being able to register in the year 2021.  As the government has started to complete the forms online, E-shram registration was also administered online. However, due to the pressure of many registrations taking place at the same time, the members have returned many times. They were compelled to register in the early morning or late evening. The shift to digital space acts as a hindrance in registering for the schemes and services.   Although the state government introduced the Duare Sarkar scheme (govt at your doorsteps) program, people are hardly accessing the schemes after submission of the forms regularly. Jharkhand  The SSK linkage was only started to post the second COVID lockdown. Pre lockdown awareness sessions & camps were not conducted due to state guidelines.   Conducting camps, especially in interior rural areas is challenging for the internet, electricity but it is also challenging to bring all the members to Pragya Kendra for linkages especially for Ayushman card, Aadhar card, caste income residential, as there is a mobility issue.   The fingerprint issue is decreasing linkages in Ayushman and Aadhar Card    The BoCW board also asks members to renew themselves every year and to get it done is very challenging to continue members to get renewed thus this year the focus was also to make applicants sensitised on getting renewed every year for proper scheme benefit linkages.    However, all these challenges and shortfalls were addressed at a ste ady pace without avoiding delays in ensuring the benefits are provided to our members.     7.3.a. Objective 3 To collectivise women workers [beedi workers, domestic workers, construction workers, street vendors, agricultural workers] to enable them to better engage with stakeholders in the value chain for full employment and have better access to markets and resources   7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments Women workers in the informal sector suffer from a multitude of challenges, one of which is that their work and their contribution to the labour force is rather unreported, and hence not valued appropriately. One of the ways SEWA has brought recognition to the issues and rights of these women is by the dual action of organising and collectivism. This type of mobilisation is guided by two realms that are close to the informal women worker i.e. community based and trade-based.    Trade Committee meetings:    SEWA Bengal has also formed trade committees for beedi rollers and weavers  and the committees hold meetings and discuss trade-specific issues and jointly formulate action plans to address the issues. A total of 5 Trade committee meetings were organised in Murshidabad with  106 members where the discussion centred around trade-related issues including low wages, limited access to healthcare, and social security and the formulation of an action plan to address the issues through advocacy at the Block and District level. Similar activities have been conducted in Jharkhand, where Trade committee Groups/Members have taken the issues ahead and an equal amount of time has also been dedicated to creating an understanding of their responsibilities and functions by the committee members to ensure positive impact. The  SEWA National Council has also guided to make the trade committee members functional by participating in their regular meetings.    Multi-Stakeholder Consultations:   A series of important stakeholder meetings were organised by SEWA in West Bengal with government representatives. In Berhampore, a meeting was conducted to discuss trade-related issues of beedi rollers where the Assistant Labor Commissioner, members of the different trade unions, Mahajan and aagewans were present. A joint action plan was formulated to address the issues faced by beedi rollers. It has been decided that the Unions along with SEWA Bharat in West Bengal will draft a letter and submit it to the Labour Minister.    In Malda, another meeting was organised in  Manikchak, Malda in the presence of Block Level representatives from various government departments including NRLM, MGNREGA, and CITU as well as the private sector including representatives of Pataka beedi company and Mahajan. This meeting gave a platform for our sisters to directly share their trade-related issues with a variety of important stakeholders. The stakeholders addressed the issues raised by our sisters and also discussed various skill -based training which can provide an alternate means of livelihood. On the 23rd of March SEWA Bharat in Jharkhand along with other two organisations, Gharelu Kamgar Sangathan & Nirmana, stood for the rights of domestic workers to be considered and performed a demonstration in front of Raj Bhavan in Ranchi with the demands.  More than 30 domestic workers participated in the demonstration and a few SEWA members also spoke for their rights. A demand letter (mentioning, the rectification of ILO convention 189 by the Central government and bringing law for the domestic workers in India, decent wage to be provided by employers, social security schemes to be introduced more for the domestic workers and to be treated well with dignity in their workplace) was submitted to the MPs of Jharkhand. ILO convention points were highlighted.  The National Platform for Domestic Workers (NPDW) provided an opportunity for the domestic worker representatives to participate and learn to mobilise and organise domestic workers to stand for their rights in Jharkhand . Through the platform, the domestic workers also learnt about their part of the responsibilities to achieve a conducive workplace. In 2021, two domestic workers from Jharkhand, Pinki Minj & Swarnlata Devi (Swarnlata Ben is also a state domestic worker representative), along with Anisha Ben (SEWA Sathi, a domestic worker Mobiliser) participated. The NPDW conducted a two-day workshop for the SEWA domestic worker and facilitated conversation on minimum wage, rate chart and social security aspects. A few highlights of the workshop:  The domestic worker representative had to present their work done in the state and it was decided to mobilise in new areas/basis through which 300 new domestic workers will be organised in 2022.   Through the NPDW, SEWA Jharkhand is now able to connect with other organisations working for the domestic workers and raising voices in front of the government for the domestic workers.    Promoting Alternative Livelihoods: West Bengal Orientation on short term training courses under Gramdyog Vikas Yojna, KVIC  Agewans and community members were oriented on various short term training courses under Gramodyog Vikas Yojana. Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is a statutory body under the Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India that works towards providing employment, producing saleable articles and creating self-reliance amongst the poor and building up a strong rural community spirit. The meeting was attended by agewans and community women as well as youth group members from all blocks of Murshidabad and Malda. Skill-based Training SEWA Bharat in West Bengal has been running SEWA Youth Resource Centres in Murshidabad focusing on providing alternative livelihood training (mainly tailoring) to get young girls out of beedi rolling. In both SYRCs, one special class has been added for advanced training. In the 2021 -22 financial year, 198 girls received tailoring training. A total of 51 girls have moved completely out of beedi rolling and into garment making.  Encouraging Social Entrepreneurship  To promote sustainable livelihood, SEWA Bharat in Raghunathganj block with the sup port of a locally placed SBI fellow initiated a project on small scale production and marketing of a snack item locally known as Nimki, currently, 3 women are being supported in running this project and scaling it up to a sustainable social enterprise owned by the community women.   Jharkhand A discussion on alternative livelihoods with agriculture workers cum forest worker members, aagewans and adolescent girls yielded a few opportunities - such as producing leaf plates, engaging in animal husbandry, and organising skill training for adolescent girls.  Biodegradable leaf plates and bowls In the Daru Block, a 10 group of agriculture worker-members developed a team to work on leaf plates and bowl stitching during leaf season and the local SEWA team will explore market linkages with local vendors in Jhumra. A demo with ten women was conducted in September-October, 2021, right before Dusherra Puja. This was the first opportunity for those 10 women to make a living using locally available resources. This was a big motivation for the local team as well - setting an example of nurturing the local economy. This opportunity will be explored further to check for viability and scale.  Animal Husbandry Exploring further livelihood opportunities within the agriculture secto r is one way to go - in Hazaribagh, Animal husbandry work is of equal importance as the women struggle with good practices when it comes to cattle rearing (cow, goat, buffalo, hen). There is substantial scope for augmenting the existing incomes of women engaged in animal husbandry if such practices are adopted. Currently, bringing their animals to the veterinary doctors is a challenge and has caused animal deaths in many cases. In late 2021, SEWA Bharat started a program to develop 10 Pashu Sakhis in Hazari bagh. These Pashu Sakhis from different villages can then cater to SEWA members in keeping their goats healthy by providing first aid and guiding them and in preparing good quality fodder (Pashu Aahar) for them. SEWA Bharat also called in an expert team from Bihar that visited Hazaribagh in December 2021 and February 2022 and a 10 -day session was conducted consisting of both a classroom session and field exposure. Today,  the 10 Pashu Sakhi are actively working in their local and neighbouring villages. Incr ease of monthly income in the range of INR 900 to INR 1500 has been reported by the Pashu Sakhis.  Skill Training for Adolescent Girls The team in Hazaribagh has recently begun to work on the skill development of Adolescent girls to prepare them for connecting with income sources while they are pursuing their education. 9 adolescent girls have been trained in Sohrai painting (the famous Jharkhand art) through one of the renowned organisations called  Sohrai Kala Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samittee '' in Hazaribagh. These girls have completed their training in March 2022 and continue to practice. Once their skill is developed, SEWA Bharat will support these girls to market their paintings through Anubandh which is an online SEWA e -marketplace. Other interested SEWA members too can join this training.  Entering the Digital World In SEWA Jharkhand, adolescent girls are today given a platform for understanding digital tools as a means of livelihood. 5 girls from Hazaribagh & Ranchi have been trained in conducting online surveys and have been able to make an earning of more than INR 5000 each. The purpose of providing them with this training is to meet the growing need of collecting primary data, through digital means as has been deemed necessary during the pandemic. Many CSOs and government organisations seek such data.     7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls The continuous waves of COVID- 19 pandemic and everlasting restrictions and safety guidelines, along with the lack of market and livelihood opportunities have affected the income cycle of the unorganised sectors. The situation continued to deteriorate with each passing Day making revenues of livelihood scarce and resources limited.   The situation is further aggravated by the ongoing debate around labour codes in India whereby there is no concrete support for the workers under the various labour codes at present. Specifically, the facilities of the beedi workers have been cut down through the code. They are the victims of the double burden. Although the state government every six months reviews the minimum wages for the beedi workers. However, in West Bengal, the minimum wages are fixed through the tripartite meeting and these minimum wages are much lower than the governments fixed minimum wages.  On the other hand in Jharkhand, the major challenge witnessed is the lack of interest of members to invest in full-day trainings, as it results in loss of livelihoods,  therefore they do not seem to understand the larger objective behind providing those training, thereby defeating the purpose of capacity building      8.",
        "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? Though the pandemic has challenged every aspect of our daily lives, and especially that of informal women workers, it has helped us rethink and restrategize design and implementation at the community level.   The agewans played the role of SEWAs front line workers, taking on the risk to reach each member to ensure they have access to food and health services during the pandemic. They conducted door to door visits while there were mobility restrictions and supported relief work by identifying ultra vulnerable families from their communities. SEWA in West Bengal worked collaboratively with Right to Food Network to advocate for food security of the marginalised.  The shift to the digital modes of work necessitated by the lockdown spurred a change to adopt digital literacy for the local teams and agewans. Online training was organised with agewans, youth members as well as the local SEWA teams to make sure the work doesn't stop. The use of virtual means of meeting such as Zoom and Google Meets was adopted. The agewans also led the teleconsultation service provided by SEWA for virtual help and treatment. While the pandemic threatened the necessities including food, clothing and shelter, it also made it certain that providing financial literacy to women is paramount if they want to acquire financial management skills to help them to cope with economic shocks.  The pandemic exacerbated poverty and hunger pushing people into the vicious cycle of economic stagnation. To meet the challenges posed by the pandemic SEWA in West Bengal tried to explore opportunities for income generation by collaborating with Khadi Village Industries. This will allow the team to increase their focus on the skill development of members and pivot to alternative livelihoods if needed.   With an increase in cases of early and forced child marriages owing to the pandemic, the youth group members have been vigilant within their communities to prevent child marriages and raise awareness among their peers.   The project enabled the local teams to focus on record keeping and maintaining member databases. The team has understood the importance of capturing outcomes and not just outreach, which is important to constantly question our key assumptions, and use program learnings to inform program design.   Both states have acknowledged extending handholding support to the agewans and adolescent girls. For instance, this cadre will form the second generation of SEWA Jharkhand which is crucial to ensure the sustainability of development programmes in the state. The team has learnt that it is equally important to collaborate with other local actors - be it government bodies or representatives such as ASHA workers, or Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) to create a conducive ecosystem.     NITI Consultancy, an external organisation was introduced to SEWA Bharat by OAK Foundation, to improve internal data systems and monitoring practices.    9.",
        "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?  Both teams will focus on improving the interface with government authorities to ensure the fulfilment of the rights of beedi workers, domestic workers, agricultural workers and domestic workers. For instance, the West Bengal team will continue to advocate for linking beedi workers with the Provident Fund by conducting stakeholders meetings at the block and district level, and ensuring strong follow up. Another example relevant for both states is to prepare a comprehensive rate chart for domestic workers to reduce exploitation at the workplace and ensure fair wages.  To ensure optimum impact and sustainable change, continuing to invest in the capacity building and empowerment of agewans is vital.   The teams will strengthen collaboration with the District level child protection unit to regularise VLCPC meetings at the block level and involve youth groups in creating awareness and reducing the rate of early marriage within the intervention area.  It is important to further explore what digitisation means for the informal sector, including the implications of going digital for women workers in the informal economy. The objective here is to ensure that they are not left behind and to fully understand the digital space to further their livelihoods.    10.",
        "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?  At the organisational level, the team will ensure that the learnings of the program are introduced and shared with aagewans, to ensure that monitoring and learning exercises are democratic and most effective. Similarly, the team will amplify the learnings of the program with other state teams, allowing them to exchange best practices, as well as reflect on their program designs.   SEWA Bharat also organised a webinar partnership with the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India, titled Women Micro-Entrepreneurs in the Informal Economy: Resilience and Growth''. More than 230 persons participated in the event to hear presentations by experts in the field including the Secretary, m/o MSME and India Leads of UN Women and USAID. A film featured during the webinar Voices from the Ground'' showcased the stories of three microentrepreneurs including Basmati ben from Jharkhand who represent thousands of women microentrepreneurs who have fought adversities and dreamt of building a self-reliant future. Their journeys show that the right kind of support in the form of credit, access to affordable childcare and healthcare, linkages to the market, and financial and digital literacy creates a holistic ecosystem for women microentrepreneurs within the informal economy to grow. This film was also shared with the state teams so that the field mobilizers could use it to encourage entrepreneurial spirits among informal women workers.  SEWA Bharat runs a fortnightly newsletter that features highlights, achievements and learning from various programmes and collaborations which is shared with a multitude of stakeholders.      11.

What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).   Summary: In 2022, Pratham expanded into North Bengal with a focus on providing vocational training to youth from tea garden communities in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, and Alipurduar districts. The strategic location of the project also ties well with Prathams intention to expand its presence in the East and North-Eastern parts of India. Key Outcomes: The program significantly impacted the lives of tea garden youth, offering them stable employment with salaries ranging from Rs. 9,500 to Rs. 14,264 per month, along with accommodation and food. Community engagement initiatives, including tool-kit exhibitions and camps, fostered trust and enhanced foundational skills in reading, math, and English among children and youth in tea garden communities. Collaborations with organizations like Transform Trade, Swaniti Initiatives, FPA, Nazdeeq, and KABIL enhanced community mobilization and resource-sharing efforts. Pratham's funding efforts from CSR initiatives, HNIs, and foundations are poised to further strengthen this intervention, ensuring sustainability. In summary, Pratham's expansion into North Bengal in its first year of the multi-year grant has made substantial progress towards its objectives of providing vocational training, securing formal employment, and fostering community engagement in tea garden communities. The program has transformed individual lives but also laid the foundation for lasting positive impacts on the region's youth and their families in the coming years of the intervention. The communities residing in North Bengal face precarious living conditions, largely reliant on employment opportunities presented by tea plantation owners. Challenges such as meager wages, seasonal employment fluctuations, constraints imposed by plantation owners, and a dearth of alternative income avenues have long been endemic. Pratham's proactive approach seeks to address these issues directly by engaging with the youth of tea garden areas. Keeping in mind the niche challenges of human trafficking faced by the tea-garden communities, the program embeds special counseling sessions and end-to-end migration support for youth who get placed out of their district. This in-turns is geared towards tackling the issue of unsafe migration and trafficking. Pratham's commitment extends beyond North Bengal, as we aim to expand our endeavors throughout West Bengal, informed by our ongoing programs and a deep understanding of industry  Oak Progress Report.    3 demands and community needs. The set target for the current year involves training 320 youth from tea garden regions, endowing them with the skills and knowledge necessary for thriving within industry-specific job placements. The aim is to secure industry-relevant job opportunities for 80% of these trained individuals, effectively creating a transformative impact on both individual lives and the larger community. In introducing the vocational training vertical within this new geography, we strategically leveraged our existing network to establish a presence. The selection of the training centers location was meticulously considered, with factors like proximity to the tea-garden communities, availability of essential infrastructure, and a high demand for vocational training playing pivotal roles in the decision-making process. Prior to setting up the establishment, we engaged with various stakeholders, including the local community, government authorities, local NGOs, and potential employers, funding partnerships that would later prove instrumental. The initial activities undertaken were encompassing site preparation, recruitment of staff, curriculum development tailored to local needs, and an extensive marketing and outreach campaign to create awareness within the community. To mobilize youth for training, a multifaceted approach was adopted, involving community engagement and awareness drives in collaboration with local NGOs. Through this meticulous planning and execution, over the past 10 months, the project has successfully trained 321 youths, with 98% of them securing placements across various states, highlighting its impactful contribution to skill development and employment in the region.

Ltd, Baxy Limited, Best Koki Automotive Private Limited, Osl Tata Motors, Topsel Toyota, and A.K Automatics mostly in the manufacturing industry as machine operators or assistant technicians. These positions are offering salaries of Rs. 11,000 along with food and, in some cases, traveling allowances. In the Hospitality trade, students have been placed in renowned establishments like Mayfair Himalayan Spa Resort, ITC Grand Chole, Hotel Bodhi Palace, The Landmark Hotel, Lemon Tree Premier, and Summit Hermon Hotel & Spa. The highest salary offered here is Rs. 14,264/-, and salaries typically of Rs. 9,500, along with accommodation and food for the role of Room Attendants. The composition of enrolled students exhibits a gender imbalance, with 173 females and 278 males, totaling 451 students. There is a significant importance in implementing strategies to foster gender inclusivity within vocational training programs, aiming to encourage greater female participation. Furthermore, the distribution of students based on their highest education qualification illustrates a diverse educational landscape among participants, with 239 having completed their education up to  Oak Progress Report.    4 the 11th and 12th grades and 185 possessing educational backgrounds ranging from the 8th to the 10th grade. Consequently, there is a need for customized training approaches that can cater to this educational diversity effectively. In terms of economic inclusion, a substantial majority of students (242) report monthly incomes below 5,000, emphasizing the program's appeal to economically disadvantaged individuals. Nevertheless, the absence of students with incomes exceeding 20,000 suggests a potential opportunity to broaden the program's reach to participants from a more extensive income spectrum. Placements have been made in various states for both the Auto 4W and Hospitality programs. For Auto 4W, placements are present in 9 districts across Haryana, Rajasthan, and West Bengal. The Hospitality program has placements in states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. Qualitative Insights: The team has made multiple observations during visits to the community and industry partners over the last 10 months. The following are some key insights from their observations: Community Level Insights A team of 8 mobilization mentors conducted various community engagement activities - meetings and discussions with ICDS, Self-Help Groups, Parents and youth on a daily basis across the tea garden communities of the 5 districts to spread awareness about vocational education led employment pathways. Such mobilization formats have been used by Pratham across 26 states in India and have been positively received by different communities. Given the historically difficult issues of human trafficking and livelihood related challenges, the community initially has inhibitions on trusting the organization and the program being offered. However, consistent efforts from the team by conducting different awareness activities eventually built trust among community members. Videos of the center, alumni members who have completed the course and have now been placed in a formal job went a long way in providing evidence about the program and its benefits. Community members were invited to visit the center, see the program and interact with the students to help bring in more transparency. Certificate & offer letter distribution ceremony was conducted within community spaces where everyone gathered to felicitate youth who have graduated in vocational courses from those communities. These youth became role models inspiring others to take the vocational education pathway and get access to alternate livelihood opportunities. A gradual transition from hesitancy and uncertainty to trust and potentially positive pathway was observed in the perception of community members.  In addition to meetings and discussions, community engagement was driven through the following different formats: Tool-kit exhibitions: The main intent behind organizing toolkit exhibitions is to take the toolkits of various programs to the youth far and wide and expose them to the opportunities available in vocational skilling. By taking the tools to the heart of the community, the idea is to encourage the youth to interact with the tools and know more about this discipline. The goal behind these exhibitions is to forge a connection with the local communities and create a presence. These have been conducted in high-schools, colleges and market spaces within the communities. Community volunteers were engaged in offering support with exhibition displays and spreading the word about this event. The tools were put on display on different tables in a circular structure along with information pamphlets and Pratham staff available to explain about the tools and their usage. Such a display format sparked much curiosity among students and community members to know more about vocational training and livelihood pathways available after training. The team received a positive response from all visitors leading to many youth enrolling into the program. 10 tool kit exhibitions of Automotive 4W and Hospitality F&B trades were conducted across Nagrakata, Banarhat, Madarihat-Birpara, Kalchini, Alipurduar, Kumargram blocks in the past 5 months. Around 2142 community members including youth and parents engaged in this activity.    Oak Progress Report.    5 Summer Reading Camps: Igniting community participation and ownership, the summer reading camp program aimed at involving mothers and youth in building foundational reading and math competencies in children of std. 1-3. Mothers and youth were trained by Pratham mentors following the ASER testing and Teaching at the Right Level methodology who then conducted these camps with children of the tea-gardens. 853 mothers and youth actively participated in these camps helping 1492 children to learn within their own community space across Banarhat Block (21 TGs), Madarihat ( 12 TGs), Falakata Block (4 TGs), Kalchini Block (19 TGs), Alipurduar Blocks (8 TGs), Kumargram Block (7 TGs). English (Angrezi Okay Please ) Camps: These are activity based camps conducted with youth and children (Std.6-8) to build foundational English speaking and reading skills. 654 youth and 120 children registered and participated in this camp across Kumargram Block (3 TG), Nagrakata Block (20 TG), Banarhat Block ( 4 TGs).  The Summer Reading Camps and English (Angrezi Okay Please) Camps have been impactful initiatives aimed at enhancing foundational skills in reading, math, and English among children and youth in various tea-garden communities. While these initiatives were not supported by the Oak grant component but by other donors, it's essential to note that they are ongoing activities. This suggests a long-term commitment to education and community development in the area of intervention. The sustained nature of these programs indicates our aim to nurturing educational growth and community involvement in the regions mentioned. The continuation of these initiatives reflects goal of creating lasting positive impacts on the learning outcomes and opportunities for children and youth within these tea-garden communities. The larger intention behind all of the above engagement methods is to form groups of community volunteers and set-up social structures which can help sustain the program in the long-run. All of the above initiatives were received positively by the community fostering a sense of hope for a better future through alternative livelihood pathways. A clear change in perception is visible with respective livelihood pathways and households are finding merit in encouraging their children to pursue formal job opportunities within/outside the state. Placement Insights: Pratham has a robust placement and post-placement support system to help youth have a smooth transition for the formal workforce after completing their training. It has partnered with 7000+ industry organizations across India to offer entry-level jobs to its trainees. The industry demand data is fed into Prathams database every month to map potential trainees based on their location preference. Pre-placement counseling includes an exclusive session on matching expectations from the industry and challenges that a new workplace and migration may bring forth. Trainees are then mapped to their preferred jobs and they are hand-held to prepare for interview and final joining formalities. Virtual calls are conducted with Pratham alumni already working in the mapped industry properties to offer a real-time experience of the food, culture and living conditions in that location. This helps bridge the information gap and build trust among trainees who are about to join the same workplace. It also gives them assurance that they have a group of people to support them if needed. Placement associates then accompany trainees to their destination location in case they are migrating, others are checked upon through phone calls for any support needed during joining.  Post-placement support includes a monthly support call from Pratham team to understand youths current employment status, challenges at the workplace and requirement of another placement. The data is collected & maintained in the central M&E system. This helps us gauge movement within industries, job changes and overall retention rates. Pratham understands that our alumni may need support and guidance even after they complete our programs. To this end, we also have set up a toll-free number (1800-12-000-4007) that is active from 10 am to 6 pm every day. Our program teams actively circulate these numbers among our alumni groups to ensure that our graduates are aware of this valuable resource. Whether our alumni need assistance with job placement or any other kind of support, they can reach out to us on these  Oak Progress Report.    6 numbers. We make it a priority to respond to all queries within two days of receiving the call. This helps us provide timely assistance and ensures that our alumni continue to receive the support they need to succeed. Batch-wise WhatsApp groups and an Instagram page dedicated for alumni support has also been created to share information and provide support. The Instagram page hosts reels and testimonials of Pratham alumnis journey and experiences. Our placement coordinators and center teams believe in building a strong community among our alumni, and to this end, they organize events on special occasions and festivals. These events are held either at our training center or at a location in the city, allowing our alumni to reconnect, catch up, and share their experiences with their fellow graduates, trainers, and center teams. These gatherings provide a valuable opportunity to network, make new connections, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry. Our alumni cherish these events and look forward to them each year. The above processes of end-to-end assistance for placement and migration have helped build confidence in trainees to join the workforce eliminating fears of unfamiliarity of a different location and culture. Given that they have a support network available at the placement destination reassures them of their safety and provision of help whenever required. The first batch of graduates have become role models for others inspiring them to drive their own career pathways. Here are some quotes from the alumni during placement: \"Working as an Assistant Technician at OSL Tata Motors is not just a job; it's a stepping stone to my future. I'm grateful for the training and opportunities Pratham provided.\" says Sanjay from Guchimari in Kumargram in Alipurduar. Sunena Shaw, a 19-year-old from Jalpaiguri District, West Bengal, faced financial struggles in her middle-class family. She joined Pratham's food and beverage service training to overcome idleness and improve her communication skills. Despite language barriers, she completed the training successfully. Now, she works at Mount Conifer Suites & Spa, earning 7000/- per month with free food and accommodation, proudly supporting her family. \"I learned a lot at the centre. I was very alert and attentive during the training sessions. Now, I can proudly say that I am able to support my family as I always wanted. It's a great feeling.\"   Need Assessment Study: A quantitative baseline survey was conducted in 73 villages across Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar, Coochbehar, and Jalpaiguri districts from 23rd- 27th November 2022. The overarching goal of the survey was to establish the current scenario in the tea-garden region in terms of the need for skill development & alternate safe employment opportunities for youth. In addition to the community survey, an industry survey was conducted to gauge the industry demand for the skilled workforce in Hospitality and Automotive sectors in North Bengal. Additionally, qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 Households across 3 districts- Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Alipurduar exploring the themes like- Employment types & pathways in tea-garden communities, Challenges pertaining to current employment, Perception of the community on different employment types- formal jobs, labor, self-employment, gig opportunities, Perception/opinion of the community regarding aspiration of employment for the current generation. The above study brought to the forefront the following insights: 1.Lack of formal employment opportunities in the region, no industry other than tea-garden factories. Tea-factories offer very few job opportunities , most of which are unskilled, semi-skilled labor jobs.  2.Youth engage/give into alcohol and drugs being depressed about not getting a job. Lack of direction and support is leading youth into delusion and often creating suicidal tendencies. Skilling will offer a direction/guidance for youth eventually leading to better mental and overall health.  Oak Progress Report.    7 3.Breaking generations of low-income trap for tea-garden families, formal job opportunities will bring in more income and subsequently improve standards of living.  4.Lack of career guidance - Youth have a strong understanding of completing high school education (Class 12th) but lack the necessary guidance to make informed decisions about higher education and career path. This has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge regarding the wide array of career opportunities that are available.  5.Government jobs seem the most aspired option for college graduates - Many young people who manage to complete their graduation in any field have their sights set on securing a government job. They spend significant time preparing for such competitive exams, often spending years. This trend highlights the enduring appeal of government jobs which is synonymous with stability and security of job.  6.Employment Challenges in Tea Garden - Tea Gardens were once a reliable source of employment for families across generations. However, there are now concerns about change in ownership which may bring modification in terms and conditions or even the permanent closure of tea gardens. In this context, it is important to explore alternative employment opportunities that can provide a more sustainable livelihood.  7.Migration among youth has emerged as a prevalent trend in this area where the younger generation is willing to take the risk of moving out to different regions across the country in search of better job opportunities. An increasing number of young people from the area are migrating to other regions and finding employment in the hospitality or O&M (electrical, plumbing) sectors. Many of them do not have any prior training or relevant skills and learn on the job. These opportunities are often obtained through personal networks, with someone from their area having worked there previously These findings have been helpful in getting a deeper understanding of the tea-garden community and developing the program delivery strategy. Collaborative Value Creation:  Prathams efforts in North Bengal have been further cultivated due to the  partnerships and collaborations that serve as instrumental pathways to attaining the multifaceted objectives of this program and amplifying the overarching community impact. Following is the overview of the collaborative efforts with some of the Oak partners, and potential funders: 1.         Transform Trade: Pratham's collaboration extended to partnering with Prasari, the implementing arm of Transform Trade, which operates in various blocks including Malbazar, Meteli, Gorubathan, and Kalimpong. The collaboration encompasses joint mobilization initiatives in Gorubathan and Malbazar areas. This partnership has already facilitated mobilization of 20 students from tea gardens such as Kumai, Jayantike, Abheel, and Hope, spanning Kalimpong, Darjeeling, and Jalpaiguri regions. 2.         Swaniti Initiatives: Pratham's partnership with Swaniti will involve a mutually beneficial exchange, where they share posters and training material on social entitlement schemes. This symbiotic collaboration will extend to Pratham providing awareness posters about our programs in multiple languages for Swaniti's usage. 3.         FPA (Family Planning Association): Focusing on women who have faced abuse, a collaboration will aim to pilot a program that equips them with industry-specific skills, and a livelihood opportunity. 4.         Nazdeeq: The partnership with Nazdeeq is marked by resource sharing for wider community dissemination. Integrating Nazdeeq's legal empowerment content into Pratham's non-technical sessions will enrich the learning experience. Collaboration extends to facilitating connections with groups for mobilization and enhancing outreach.  Oak Progress Report.    8 6.         KABIL: The proposal of enrolling youth from KABIL's communities into Pratham's program will introduce a comprehensive approach to sustainable income generation. To bolster our mobilization efforts further, we have strategically connected with local NGOs including CASA (Church's Auxiliary for Social Action) mostly working in Alipurduar region and Dooars Jagron. Additionally, we have also received support from Parimal Mitra Smriti Mahavidyalaya, a local college, that provides an avenue for expanding efforts to the student demographic. Ensuring sustainability, Pratham is proactively seeking funding opportunities from CSR initiatives, HNIs, and other foundations. In Year 1 of the project, we were able to secure funding for the project, amounting to approximately INR 21 lakh, from various HNIs based out of the USA who were interested in supporting Pratham's various activities in skill building and livelihoods. Moreover, we have secured another round of funding from a consortium of HNIs (called the Swedish Partnership) worth INR 7 lakh for the project which will be used in Year 2 of the project.   These efforts are poised to secure the necessary resources to fortify this intervention and we anticipate more rounds of funding to come in for the project in the coming months.     7.c. Challenges and obstacles.  We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Objective 1 - Industry-Relevant Skills: Implementing this program in the tea garden region came with unique challenges. The susceptibility to human trafficking created a trust deficit, demanding comprehensive counselling for students and families. Sensitizing them to potential risks and safeguards was essential to ensure their safety and well-being while acquiring industry-relevant skills. Objective 2 - Employment Linkage: Building trust and credibility was crucial due to past negative experiences with NGOs. Establishing commitment, transparency, and tangible positive impact was necessary to overcome this hurdle. Engaging the community in open dialogue and decision-making processes played a vital role in rebuilding trust and linking youth to formal job opportunities. Objective 3 - Support Network: The lack of a physical presence initially affected enrollment rates, as potential participants questioned the program's legitimacy. To provide a support network for youth, Pratham responded by creating awareness through alternative means like toolkit exhibitions and community engagement activities. As Pratham's presence became more established, skepticism around legitimacy diminished, and the support network for youth in terms of career guidance, migration, and placement support began to take shape. In summary, addressing the challenges in the tea garden region required strategic solutions aligned with Pratham's objectives. Building trust, providing industry-relevant skills, and linking youth to employment opportunities were all part of the journey to empower the community and help youth grow in their professional journeys.   8.",

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Physical activities started in the first quarter of 2022 and before that activities were limited to online platforms due to Covid induced global pandemic. However, five physical advocacy workshops have been conducted with each hub partner comprising on an average 40 participants from the respective partner and community members identified during the process. NCAS participated in regular meetings for planning review and coordination with hub partners along with annual review of the project. Each workshop was dedicated to explore the community issues and how the community can address it themselves based on strength and weakness. Vulnerable groups such as farmers, women, children, and migrants were identified along with their vulnerabilities such as repairing of river embankment, domestic violence, child marriages, gender discriminations, drinking water, forced migration due to lack of local opportunities, prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls, etc. Sundarban is delta region where river Ganga flows into Bay of Bengal sea. Islands surrounded by saline sea water are the primary characteristics of local geography. Every year during monsoon or cyclone saline water breaks the weakening river embankment and enters into agricultural fields and fish ponds destroying not only current crops but the farm itself. This makes the farm unproductive for the next six or more years subject to intensity of salinity. This causes huge loss to the local farmers hence; they want to repair and strengthen the river embankment. Farmers are also struggling to access the fair market price of their farm produce such as fish, vegetables etc. These issues are interlinked and need to be looked at holistically and ecologically sustainable manner. One group has already started the river embankment repairing work as an alternative model rooted in traditional knowledge and practices by planting local trees and shrubs tolerant to saline water.  State agencies are concretizing the river embankment and making the fluid ecological interface between water and land very hard and impenetrable. As an alternative to concretization of river embankment we organized \"Rethinking River Embankment\", a field exposure visit for community members and staffs, so that community members can take local and ecologically sustainable initiative in their respective villages to protect their life and livelihood. We conducted NCAS's Resource Person's meet for ideation to pursue in the next phase of the project.     7.c. Challenges and obstacles.  We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Collaboration of domain expert institutions in the community development program at Sundarban as hub partners is new experience for many and that too through a community-oriented approach. This initiative has faced numerous challenges and consciously reviewed collectively to evolve for better. The platform of the steering committee falling short to include community representative  Oak Progress Report.    3 and field level staff in the decision-making process. Communitys voice must be heard and respected at each level of decision-making process in the community-oriented approach. Hub partners struggled to reorient themselves towards the community-oriented approach. Their prior experience was limited to the service delivery, reoriented staff and organizational understanding towards this approach was very challenging and particularly to assimilate it. This also raises many questions, how do we understand community-led processes and how to include the community in the process, given that community is not one unit but many groups subject to gender, caste, class etc. Ensuring community participation in the process has so many contours to negotiate at the village level. Asking participants particularly women and girls to stay outside of home for a night to participate in a workshop was a herculean challenge itself to overcome. Another challenge which will take time to overcome is to help the community to realize that this initiative is not to address your concerns but to empower the community to address their concerns. Political contour at the village level is most difficult to manage and yet partners are struggling to figure out a strategy to deal with this. Physical accessibility of the villages scattered in islands are very limited. There are many villages which cant be accessed by roads but through boats. There is also sketchy infrastructure such as electricity and mobile networks in some areas. However, this initiative needs to address this divide through a very robust strategy to deal with this kind of challenges during execution.   8.",

However data are updated by our Kishore-Kishori Bahinis in the Registers till November 2022. Positive outcomes of the 12 Trainings, Seminars and Awareness Programs conducted on Health Awareness are as follows:  Increased usage of sanitary napkins among the girls and women. Girls and women stopped using used cloth instead resorted to the use of regular and hygienic sanitary pads. We noticed this change in case of approx. 50% of our beneficiaries (based on the data provided by the Womens Group )  Upon detection of pregnancy  women now go more for frequently for check- ups in primary health care centres instead of visiting the local quack doctors. This tendency increases by 80 to 85% approx.  Womens are more careful about their hygiene issues these days.

Challenges:  Oak Progress Report.    6 a) Our target population is affected frequently (almost every year) by natural disasters; as a result they are reluctant in adopting any existing/ new agricultural practice(s). b) The fundamental concept of Climate Adaptive Natural Farming is resorting to organic farming methods. But on ground we witness difficulties in explaining the target beneficiaries the benefits and profitability that they can reap in from practicing organic farming    7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective To reduce damage and loss by natural disasters through community awareness, education, preparedness and prediction, warning system, land use practices on natural disasters like- flood, cyclone and drought by the community people.    7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).                                      Target :3 Reduce Damage/Loss due to Natural Calamities Action: 1 20 camps held  on promotion of awareness and education on DRR preparedness and Climate Resilience 2 camps are organized to make people aware on the Warning System and post disaster relief techniques Action: 2 2 trainings held on Land use practices with demonstrations in post disaster situation Action: 3 In 1 location, (Achintyanagar GP, Paschim Sripatinagar village), this year, World Environment Day is observed Action : 4 Campaigns and Seminars, (3 in all) , are held to teach the people techniques of Sustainable Water Resource Management , Rainwater Harvesting etc.  Oak Progress Report.    7       Impact:         These activities helped almost 100 people become aware about DRR. Their present knowledge about DRR, can be rated to point no. 3 in a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is bad and 5 is excellent. The beneficiaries are also aware now about the following precautions that they are to undertake in case of approaching natural disasters. These are: a) Carefully hear the announcements made in TV, Radio, Local Panchayats and Public bodies on approaching disasters b) Following their directions the people know to stop going to rivers and forests in search of their livelihoods c) They understand the importance of protecting their valuable documents, money etc. and the methods there for  d) Learnt to remove the elderly people and their livestock to safe zones e) The trainees now can  prepare life jackets indigenously  People are now aware about the benefits of saving water and we expect them to practice Sustainable Water Resource Management and Rain Water Harvesting.                                                         7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges faced: a) In post disaster situation we face challenges in convincing the affected people to move to rescue centres / high lands because they fear of losing their primary as well as secondary livelihoods and property holdings b) Rate of migration increases in post disaster situation because the affected people are unsure of their sources of income for next 6 to 8 months. c) Our field mobilizers are unable to establish proper contact with the field because of the intervention of the local political parties; field staff can not jump into immediate intervention    7.4.a.

Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: a)  If any staff resigns from the job it is difficult on the part of the organization not only to freshly induct a new member and recapacitate him/her. The new staff may not be aware about the respective field area which prevents proper intervention as well. The pace of work will slow down considerably      7.5.a. Objective 5 Objective To reduce domestic violence and gender discrimination in society through awareness of adolescent groups, self-help groups, leadership training so that women gain respect in their family, are able to take decisions, have rights and are able to live with justice and equality.

More numbers of cases on domestic violence and gender discrimination are reported on a regular basis because of increased awareness among the women about their social rights and knowledge to live with equality, dignity and justice.   7.5.c. Objective 5 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: a) Incidences of domestic violence are not reported by women because they are fearful of the possible societal outcomes b) There are legal protections for the women facing domestic violence under various acts; but the affected ones are unaware on these. Additionally they survive in fearful situation c) A woman becoming aware of her rights, when tries to implement the same in her family, she is not respected and treated in a fair manner d) We found that Muslim community women are less interested in understanding the disadvantages of gender discrimination because of the super domination of the men ( more a patriarchal society and reluctance to accept change)    7.6.a.

These girls are rehabilitated in their respective families. Currently they are going to schools as well. 5 children in the age group of 12 to 14 years who were playing in a music band in Paschim Sripatinagar were rescued too. They are presently staying with their families and studying. 2 incidences of school dropouts in Choto Banashyamnagar are found. Both are sent back to schools.   7.6.c. Objective 6 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: a) Poor and less- privileged families continue to discriminate between a girl  and a boy child. They are more interested in getting their girls married off  early without considering if they have met their age, developed requisite physical and mental health to undergo such marriages. While conducting such social abuses, they often take resort of political parties which make these easier to accomplish b) On the other side if such incidences are detected; the girl is ultimately brought back to her family, the other members do not tend to accept them  Oak Progress Report.    11    7.7.a. Objective 7 Objective To create a peaceful and happy ambience in the family with special attention to the elderly to give them a stress free and peaceful life.    7.7.b. Objective 7 Progress.

The field mobilizers identified that: a) the elderly people are often not getting their old age pensions b) deprived of the benefits of various govt. schemes regularly. 2 persons are in record that their old age pensions are snatched by the other family members. Approx. 7 more are facing similar problems but due to family pressure and fear of ill-treatment, they are unable to divulge the information.    7.7.c. Objective 7 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: a) Elderly sons and daughters tend not to look after the aged members of their families  Oak Progress Report.    12 b) The aged and elderly are not extended love and affection by the other able members as well c) Senior family members receive old age pensions which are forcibly taken away by other members d) Political parties do not intend to support the needs of the aged. Additionally on the basis of the political affiliations - they adopt selective approach in allocation of the benefits of government based schemes and grants    7.8.a. Objective 8 Objective To reduce unsafe migration and trafficking in this area making the community and stakeholders aware and maintaining the migration register at village and panchayat level    7.8.b.

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Target :8 Reduce the happenings of unsafe migration, trafficking in the area making community and stake holders aware of the risks and maintaining migration registers Action: 1 18 meetings are held (on unsafe migration, its risks, prevention of trafficking, maintaining Village Based Watch Group Registers) Action: 2 4 Awareness Camps are organized with demonstrations for the purpose of training on small to minor scale social entrepreneurship development Action 3: 4 stakeholders meetings are held (with Asha Workers, Panchayat-Pradhan, Panchayat-Samity members, Local Vendors)  Impacts:  Cases of unsafe migration reported but stopped:  2 incidents at Boro Banashyamnagar happened. Initially they cannot be traced but later their whereabouts are found and they contacted the families. Our field mobilizers and community leaders play a very crucial role in this case. Whether incidences of unsafe migration are reducing or not; we are currently not in a position to ascertain this. But the positive thing is, now the cases are reported more often that before. We registered 400 cases of migration where people went elsewhere for better earning opportunities but at the same time their families know their whereabouts and can contact them. This gives a positive picture of this activity.         Oak Progress Report.    13  7.8.c. Objective 8 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: a) The criminals behind child and women trafficking take refuge of various political parties; so they cannot be convicted often b) Migrant labourers do not disclose their whereabouts to their families while they go for work outside. The families cannot contact, often the migrants get lost c) Trafficked girls and women are not welcomed back heartily in their families    7.9.a. Objective 9 Objective Disable persons from poor families can avail pension schemes and be oriented with some skill to work like- incense stick making, making soft toys so that they can be self dependent    7.9.b.

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Target :9 Help Disable Persons of Poor Families with Govt. benefits and provide training on acquiring skills to work and earn Action: 1 Initially we constituted Disability Groups in each GP. Later we realized that segregation of these people in the society, for whatever purpose, can create a feeling of being oppressed and left out because the challenges they face every day. As a result we incorporated them with the other groups constituted. like Farmers group, Womens group, Adolescences' group , Fishermen's group etc. [The total disabilities identified so far are: 40 ] (In Achintyanagar-22, In Banashyamnagar- 18) Action: 2 8 meetings are held to assess the skill level of the disabled people and understand the kind of jobs they prefer/ intend/ will be able to do and plan capacity building trainings accordingly. Action 3: Per Govt. Norms: Disability Certificate is issued- if the disability is 60% and above For 8 cases (Achintyanagar: 3; Banashyamnagar: 5)-we find that the beneficiaries are without the Govt. Disability Certificates. As a result these people are unable to access Govt. Sponsored Schemes or any Govt. benefits as introduced / provided from time to time for their assistance.  Oak Progress Report.    14 We referred such cases to Panchayat for obtaining residential certificates. These, when issued, are carried to the Sub Div. Hospital at Kakdwip for checking Disability Percentages and issuance of certificates   Impact:  40 cases of disabilities are reported till date. Of 8 cases that are referred for issuing Disability Certificates, 2 are issued as on date. Rest are in process.    7.9.c. Objective 9 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: a) We face challenges in combing the disable persons under one roof b) They are not aware of their rights and ownerships in society c) Obtaining disability certificates is a long drawn process. Gram Panchayat, Role of Sub Divisional Hospital etc. are keys for assessing the disability percentages of the affected   8.",

If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular objective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key staffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   * Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be commented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report. MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE (S):- From the point of view of Staff: a) Capacity Building, Awareness on various social problems affecting the vulnerable community people, learning to identify the problems using various tools and techniques b)The staff are able to create changes in their own behavioural pattern which reflect in their families and is the first step, in our own opinion, towards fulfilling the objective of this project From the point of view of Leadership: a)  Under the scope of this project we are able to create Women's Group. Some leaders of the Women's Group amplified their voices to the extent where they can go directly to the Govt. offices and get their rights and claims duly settled. (For an example: A group of women from Boro Banashyamnagar village created a huge uproar due to steep increase in their electricity bills. They claimed this increase as illegitimate, rallied to the local electricity distribution office at Patharpratima and eventually settled all the bills to a reduced sum)            Oak Progress Report.    15     9.

Objective 1 Institutionalized practices in partner organizations contribute to strengthened systems to prevent and protect Children and Young People at risk of or affected by unsafe migration and assist sustainable reintegration of survivors of trafficking and exploitation.   7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments The project emphasized importance of gender responsive approach to child protection issues and services at the system level to reduce stigma against transgender children and survivors of trafficking and sexual exploitation. Partners are collectivized to act as a network advocating for the survivors right to accessible support services and creation of local safety nets for prevention of unsafe migration. The project built capacities of CSOs to use tools for a child centred reintegration process and increased acceptance by government duty bearers and service providers.  411 frontline workers demonstrated skills on child handling and dealing with difficult behaviour of survivors following child safeguarding principles through use of tools and learnings from project trainings. 165 children reported their views are sought for and incorporated into decision making and care planning. Anecdotes from the children indicate how the tool is supporting them to reflect and share their emotions. 383 government duty bearers shared positive feedback towards the tools and guidelines developed under this project. Decentralised resource pools at district level are established, providing assistance to victims of unsafe migration. 45 inter-agency meetings conducted  and 391 cases were supported through this collaboration, which ensured that the voices of the children are heard and the stakeholders in the ecosystem are involved to ensure that Children and Young People (CYPs) recieve quality services. Safeguarding Community of Practice has been established with 54 members to promote safety in the process of reintegration. 379 child care professionals increased knowledge of Child Safeguarding. CSOs were capacitated to support Mental Health, functioning and Psychosocial Wellbeing of survivors of trafficking. 243 frontline workers increased their knowledge on Psychosocial Resilience Framework and 220 front line workers are now able to monitor Psychosocial Wellbeing of CYPs including survivors by using tools developed by Tdh, UNICEF and a checklist developed by the partners.   7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls Multiple challenges were faced during the implementation of the BECOME Tool by the frontline workers. The main challenges and feedback given on the use of the tool was that it is  too time consuming and many times Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) with whom the tool is applied loose concentration or are unwilling to tell his/her story to be able to complete the process. The partner organisations are working at various stages of the entire spectrum of the anti-trafficking space, and come with different levels of capacity and skill sets. For this reason it was challenging to build content around trainings that accommodated the needs of all. For conducting the online training sessions with the frontline workers, one of the challenge was consistent internet  connectivity while the level of understanding among all the frontline workers were not found at the same level.   There could have been a more robust and s ystematic follow up on support for the trained social workers within the partner organisations by Tdh, however   Tdh faced challenges with high staff turnover of the tained social workers within the partner organisations. Inter-agency resource pool formatio n is yet to be done by 6 partner organisations who are comparatively small and have a lack of funding and inadequate information on district level resources. It was also found that these organizations faced challenges in finding trained personnel who can develop the resource pool. In Year 1 the overall challenge was the impact of COVID-19 second and third wave in the implementation and changes in the FCRA Rules which caused a 6 month delay to starting the field level implementation, which only started from July 2021 onwards. Hence, most of the partners were not able to complete the target within the 2022 annual plan.   7.2.a. Objective 2 Community level safety nets are established and functional to protect Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) and support reintegration of the victims of unsafe migration/exploitation/ trafficking in 70 Gram Panchayats of 12 districts.   7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments 103 multi-sectorial coordination meetings and 76 liasons completed with various formal and informal child protection duty bearers at district and block level. Through these, stakeholders in the ecosystem are now involved to ensure CYP recieve quality, responsive and stigma-free services. 551 formal and informal child protection duty bearers can identify child protection concerns and are aware of their responsibilities and referral pathway. 290 child protection concerns were raised and referred by the formal and informal child protection duty bearers within this reporting period. 3544 CYiM participated in leadership training, among whom 1850 children were identified by the partner to be supported to join local Child Protection Committees (CPCs) 408 children participated in local child protection committee meetings. 231 child prot ection concerns raised and reported by CYP leaders to appropriate authorities. For inclusion of the CYiM in the CPCs, 49 advocacy initiatives were completed by partner organisations with District Level Child Protection Society for making the CPCs function al in the areas where they are not functional at all or partially functioning and regarding inclusion of CYiM leaders in the CPCs and ensuring child participation. Partner organisations met with formal and informal district, ward and village level child protection duty bearesand organized consultations at the district level for establishment of CPCs. The CYiM prepared and placed a draft during the VLCPC/WLCPC formation meetings to the Panchayat Pradhan as well for formation and inclusion of CYPs in the CPC meetings. 20 CPCs at village and ward level and 1 CPC at block level have been formed in West Bengal and Jharkhand through initiatives taken by the partner organisations. The inclusion of the CYPs in the CPC meetings helped raise the voices of the children on the issues affecting their lives and to advocate for changes.   7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls   The overall challenge was the impact of COVID-19 and changes in the FCRA Rules which led to a 6 month delay in implementing field level activities.   Due to the West Bengal State elections,   the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights and other institutional structures like Child Welfare Committee and the District Child Protection Unit were not function for a period of time which m ade the advocacy work very challenging. Advocating for the mainstreaming of the tools to be incorporated within the Juvenile Justice (JJ) system in Jharkhand was not possible, and  collaboration with the State government of Jharkhand is still ongoing for steering the district level and media advocacies. The project was able to initiate organisational level advocacy and cluster level advocacy work at the district level; however, the planned state level work could not be achieved. The Empowerplus Application and Livelihood Pre-conditioning could not be dessiminated by the partner organisations in 2022as the application is under upgradation for additional features based on user feedback. Addirionally once of the core consultants working on this passed away from  COVID and retrieving and getting another person to take the work forward caused further delays. As mentioned above in the principal accomplishment of objective 2, the partner organisations have taken up various initiatives at district and local level for making the CPCs functional in West Bengal and Jharkhand. Despite the initiatives taken, some CPCs are still not functional in some of the intervention areas for which the inclusion of CYiM leaders in the CPCs and ensuring child participation was not 100% achieved as targeted.     7.3.a. Objective 3 Children and Young People at risk of or affected by unsafe migration are resilient to challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence and stigma against the survivors of trafficking and exploitation.   7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments Community safe spaces were created in 70 locations for fostering discussions and reflection on gender, sexuality and norms. The project engaged 2,054 CYP to increase their knowledge on Gender and Sexuality, risks and support services. 991 CYiM realized appropriate information related to coping with internal reactions, 334 CYiM reported a sense of calm and decreased negative emotions. 1,415 CYiM were able to identify risks they could face, 1,458 CYiM identified the institutions that can respond to their safety concerns and they know how to approach them, 2,941 CYiM demonstrated critical thinking/problem solving skills and 264 survivors and CYiM reported increased connectedness with peers, family, and kinship network. The above outputs were achieved as a result of 421 trainings on Gender and Sexuality, 310 trainings on Continuum of Care Approach, Socio Ecological Approachn of MHPSS, and 2464 workshops and reflection sessions with girls and 1811 workshops and reflection sessions with boys. Increased collective actions were observed at the community level through theatre, sports, arts by girls, boys, parents and survivors of trafficking to challenge harmful practices. 227 community based social  actions were organised by CYiM on gender based harmful practices and stigma associated with trafficking. 3,032 influential leaders and communicators participated in social action events, among them 398 influential leaders and communicators made public declarations against gender based harmful practices and have shown support to survivors. 669 community male members are able to recognise negative gender norms behind revictimization of survivors and harmful practices; like forced marriage and 564 male family members showed support to   girls by preventing early marriage and byapproaching survivors and encouraging them to live a stigma free life.   7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls Development of  Social Behaviour Change guideline based on global guidelines with techniques and tips followed is ongoing in collaboration with WINDCHANGERS, after the completion of the same, partners will be provided training on how to use the materials. Contextualisation of the stories based on the feedback from the partners and children has taken longer than anticipated, however we strongly feel that this process is critical, and therefore have not taken shortcuts to speed the process up. The understanding on gender and sexuality is varied among the project partner organisations, where a was observed among the frontline workers when they initiated discussions on gender and sexuality. For many, they felt comfortable to talk about sexuality, menstrual health, safe and unsafe touch. In conducting reflection sessions with boys, the partner organisations shared a challenge relating to the drop out. This drop out rates of boys are much higher among the boys in the age group 15 -18 years and above upto 24 years since the boys are mostly migrating out from the villages with their  families for seasonal works. In conducting reflection sessions with the girls also related to drop out, Girls who are in the age group 18- 24 years are getting married or migrating with families for work, or going out for educational purpose since there is no proper infrastructure for higher studies in most of the intervention areas. One of the challenge faced by the partners at field level is getting in touch with the male members and bringing all the male members in one place to initiate discussions. The male members are the main breadwinners of the family and most of them migrate out of the village in search of work and are therefor unavailable.    8.",

        "Grant period": "grant period: The baseline study carried out during the initial phase of Year-1, OAK Phase 3 was helpful to understand the current status of implementation. Some of the major findings were:  Need for strengthening of inter-agency resource pools at the district level for addressing immediate needs of the survivors like food, nutrition, health and livelihood support.  Providing handholding support to the partner organisations since the understanding.  District level child protection institutions and service providers have not been adequately engaged with to influence institutional processes and practices through tools, the need of training on psycho-social support, safeguarding, gender and harmful social norms, and their for have been identified to be incorporated in the new/current 3rd grant phase.  The advocacy initiatives towards sustainable reintegration must have a focus on ensu ring market oriented livelihood options to women towards empowering them as well as augmenting their family income,  Prevention of trafficking to be advocated at all levels of the government,    Engaging with relevant agencies of the state to adequately addres s the rehabilitation and reintegration needs of survivors,  Devise suitable ways of leveraging the learnings to inspire similar initiatives in the sector, as well as create models to demonstrate the results by strengthening organizations with certain strengths to support strategic growth,  Deconstruct non-negotiable features of a functional community level safety net with a focus on sustainability,  Ensuring more participation of men seems crucial as typically men are the decision makers within family,  The need of registration system at panchayat level for tracking and monitoring of influencing gram panchayats to prioritize vulnerable families under the list of potential beneficiaries of different welfare and poverty reduction programmes,  C suitable pedagogy to conduct discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality as well as engaging with community beliefs towards addressing stereotypes,  Ensuring space for survivors to engage in dialogue, create online training programmes; particularly for service providers associated with district level child protection institutions,  Strengthen inter -agency collaboration in order to envisage new avenues of skill building and livelihood opportunities for women, beyond gender stereotypes and primary sector,  Sensitization of district level child protection functionaries on standard child reintegration practices,  Currently, child safeguarding/ protection policy of most organizations doesnt seem to suggest suitable ways to respond to the harms that have happened beyond reporting or identify measures to address the immediate needs of the victim, and pandemic induced vulnerabilities needs to be taken into account   Incorporating M&E as a critical domain within the project based on the recommendation from the baseline.which we believe will add significant value to the project. An online workshop was organized for all the partner organisations, which was conducted by the M&E officer of Tdh Foundation where discussions were carried outon the project follow up tools, which the partne rs are using for reflecting the plan and result of implementation on a monthly basis. The workshop has been very beneficial for the partner organisations to develop an understanding on how to establish links between the activities planned and the results being achieved with the CYiM, and how to maintain the supporting documents. A resource document was prepared for the partners to follow, which was shared with them for streamlining the process of updating of project follow up tool. Based on the above mentio ned recommendations of the baseline study,  within this reporting period 5 decentralised resource pools  were formed in Jharkhand and 3 in West  Bengal to provide assistance to victims of unsafe migration   at the district level for addressing immediate needs of the survivors such as food, nutrition, health and livelihood support. The Formation of a project steering Core Group has been an important milestone for the Project. Given the large network of partner NGOs in the Project, the Core Group comprised of 6 NGOs in Jharkhand and 7 NGOs in West Bengal along with Tdh, to ensure the smooth functioning of the Project towards its successful conclusion. The Core Group  has been supporting Tdh to provide strategic direction of the project, determine a plan of actions for certain initiatives. The Core Group has been formed with suggestions from all the partner organizations and has a specific Terms of Reference. The membership in the core group is revolving, with a new group formed every year to allow new organisatio ns to join the group. The core committee members have added values during the review meetings and have worked on development of   safeguarding and MHPSS checklist which will be commonly followed by all the organisations in measuring the changes at the ground level. All organisations are not of equal strengths and capacity and some of them find difficulties in institutionalizing the learnings from the different trainings and workshops in their regular activities. Case management has been found to be a challeng e with several social workers expressing the need for more hand holding support. On-site technical support can be provided to social workers to enable them to develop skills for more effective case management. Hence several capacity building workshops were organized for the frontline workers in this reporting period. As a result, 14 organisations were identified (7 from West Bengal and 7 from Jharkhand) among the 30 partner organisations as piloting partners (partners who will pilot the negative gender norm  change intervention to reduce stigma and violence against the survivors which falls under outcome 3). The selection of these 14 piloting  partners was based on capacities of the organisations and was done in a consultative and transparent way. The remainin g partner organisations are identified as the non -piloting partner organisations and are working only under outcome 1 and 2.     The delays and restrictions as a result of COVID-19 helped the team to learn how to be agile by changing operational practices, ways of communication and work. In adapting to the changing context and ways of working, the project team digitalised the trainings and learningsto provide blended victim support services. During the monitoring visits, from the field anecdotes were collec ted from the CYP and Stakeholders to document changes taking place as a result of the intervention. Some of the anecdotes are mentioned below- I am Ayesha, I am a youth leader of Sabuj Sathi group. I have received many training as a youth leader. I have received mental support, educational support like books, tuition fees etc. from GGBK. In this year, I have passed my secondary examination. I am very happy to be a part of this youth leadership programme. We children of Baridih, Bero Block,Ranchi found this process of Kabaddi very helpful during this period of lockdown. We never had such opportunity to think about our mental wellbeing through games and other activities.  During this lockdown we were closed at home and we were totally cut off from the peer groups but this process gives us opportunity to sit together and discuss on the child protection issues. We learnt how to sit together and help each other and express our views after this important intervention in our village and learnt about gender  and other child protection concerns and how the harmful social norms are so deeply rooted within our thought process. There is a playground in my village in which only boys used to play. There was no place for girls to play with other girls. Once the boy and the girl were given training on gender and leadership by the NGO didi , it could change the mindset and awareness of both the boys and the girls.As a result both the teams have agreed  to play on the same field. Now both boys & girls are enjoying Kab addi / Badminton or football game together along with their peers in the same field. Through mapping process of YouCreate I have explored the resources of my village and also identified problems which has helped me to understand a picture of my area where I stay. I am a Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) leader, I have learnt leadership and I know how to manage problems of my own life and my peer group members.-Statements from the CYP s I am a local language teacher in a government school. I am fami liar with the school's teaching and learning rules, but child protection was a new word for me. I didnt had adequate information about what is trafficking, child safeguarding, child marriage and CHILDLINE, although the child rights had been heard. There have been a series of meetings and trainings for  Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) conducted at the school, in which I have also had the opportunity to attend many times. This made us knowledgeable. In view of their needs, especially for the safe place of the girl child, a room has been allotted to Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) group in the school where they perform meetings and other activities as a group.   From the COVID pandemic period, I have seen that children have stopped studying and co ntinuously playing or going to forest for collecting woods as  a source of income. So, after the schools have started after lockdown, only 50% children have started going to school. Now, I along with the village level volunteers have started tracking the children who are out of school to bring them back and readmitted them in school. Because according to me, if children can be bought back to the mainstream of education then all problems of child marriage, child trafficking and child labour will be less in numbers, as children will find an objective in their life to go ahead in future. -Statements from the stakeholders and influential leaders I never used to take part in household work but now I help my wife. I also used to discriminate between male and female children, but my outlook has been changed. I have understood the issues of Toxic Masculinity and have changed myself after attending the meetings. Now I protest whenever I observe any violence against women and I also invite other to protest.  Now I can understand and identify the gender discrimination's existing in our society, and trying to change myself. -Statements from the male members   9.",
        "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? Based on the learnings of Year 1 of OAK Phase-3, in Year 2 the plan is as followed: 1. Partner organisations have been provided with handholding support on BECOME Tool, MHPSS, Gender and Sexuality, Safeguarding etc. since the understanding of the tools and other relevant topics under this intervention required more support. 2. 1 state level consultation in West Bengal, 103 multi-sectorial coordination meetings and 76 liasons have been done with various formal and informal child protection duty bearers to make the community level safety net functional with a focus on sustainability, advocating on prevention of trafficking at all levels of government and engaging with relevant agencies of the state to address the rehabilitation and reintegration needs of the survivors. 3. Considering the power dynamics, participation of men seems crucial as typically men are the decision makers within the family, hence in Year 1, 669 male members can recognise negative gender norms behind revictimization of survivors and harmful practices; like forced marriage and 564 male family members show support to girls by preventing early marriage and to survivors by encouraging them to live a stigma free life. 4. Through development of the module on gender and sexuality, training sessions were organized with the frontline wo rkers on Gender and Sexuality, and the project engaged  with 3032 influential leaders and communicators in various social events to conduct discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality as well as engaging with community beliefs towards addressing stereotypes. 5. Community safe spaces have been created in all the 70 locations to ensure safe spaces for the CYP to engage in dialogue. 6. Online training programmes are created on Child Protection, Gender and Sexuality, MHPSS, Safeguarding for the service providers associated with district level child protection institutions. 7. The inter-agency collaborations were strengthened to envisage new avenues of skill building and livelihood opportunities for women through linkage with varios government schemes, scholarships and vocational trainings.   8. Training has been provided to the organisation level and field level focal points on the 5 modules of safeguarding  to ensure that the organizations ensure suitable ways to respond to the harms that have happened beyond reporting or identify measures to address the immediate needs of the victim. 9. Pandemic induced victims were taken into considerations where the children who have lost one or both parents during the pandemic were linked with various schemes of the gover nment like sponsorship scheme, and the education system through admission in Kasturba Gandi Vidyalayas, and dry ration support through linkage with CHILDLINE etc. Through the   following initiatives based on the feedback received from children during the ba seline evaluatuion, the voices of the children raised have been considered at all levels of intervention. In Year 2, the aim is to achieve results that could not be achieved in Year 1, and to respond to the recommendations from the evaluation, such as implementation of the child protection policy of Ministry of Women and Child development in every school in the intervention areas, leveraging learnings to inspire similar initiatives in the sector, create models to demonstrate results by strengthening organiz ations with certain strengths in the strategic direction, leveraging organizations capacity on psychosocial interventions, registration system at Panchayat level for tracking and monitoring, Influencing Gram Panchayats to prioritize vulnerable families un der the list of potential beneficiaries of different welfare and poverty reduction programmes and engaging with relevant agencies of the state to adequately address the rehabilitation and reintegration needs of survivors. Based on this, the following actibivities for the 2nd year are planned: 1. Capacity building support to  grass root level workers who are continuously engaging in all the activities at field level. The capacity building workshops have been planned to be done primarily on Gender and Sexuality and MHPSS through face to face discussions and activity oriented sessions which the frontline workers can use during field level implementation. 2. Based on feedbacks received from the frontline workers during the review meetings and partners meet, handholding support in Empowerplus upgraded version and the Livelihood Preconditioning Tool will be provided.   3. Training of Trainers (TOT) on Problem Management Plus (PM+) a WHO transdiagnostic psychological intervention for common mental health problems for the fro nt line workers for psychological intervention program, that can be delivered by non-specialist counsellors. 4. The Core Committee Group which has been formed in West Bengal and Jharkhand will be restructured again since the group is of revolving nature to fo ster the principles of partnership, participation and collaboration in the project more effectively. 5. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will be revived in West Bengal and Jharkhand in Year-2 The members of the TAG will support in providing technical inputs for revising the tools, align the tools developed with Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 and will provide support in strategic advocacy with government. 6. E-learning materials will be developed on the 5 basic child protection laws of India in  local languages (Hindi and Bengali) which will promote understanding among the frontline workers on the legal framework. 7. The plan in Year 2 is to conduct a series of state and district level consultations in West Bengal and Jharkhand on Gender Responsive Prevention and Response to Child Protection with Child Protection Duty Bearers and with Media on Ethical Reporting to focus more on the engagements with government bodies and media and boost up the advocacy initiatives. 8. Tdh staffs will be more available to the partners (specially Jharkhand) to support Gender and Norm intervention, MHPSS Intervention through sports and art methodologies due to the low  level of understanding among partners. 9. Tdh will create more space for knowledge and information sharing among the partners as exchange of ideas, actions and good practices play an important role in design and plan for advocacy.    Longitudinal study will be conducted to understand diffusion in social norms change around gender among adolescent and young people and its outcome on stigma against the survivors of exploitation, their social cohesion and psychosocial resilience. The objective of the longitudinal study is to understand how structured CYiM led social behaviour change communication interventions contribute to organised diffusion in social norms change and supporting social cohesion, psychosocial resilience and then effectively reduced stigma against survivors of exploitation. This study will further help us to understand the conditions that help or hinder changes in gender norms.   10.",

Progress Report for the period of 1/07/2021 to 31/10/22     During Second wave of Covid-19, we started working in the field to form community groups. As many issues were discussed during Micro level planning, the groups started forming based on various issues associated with different communities like farmers groups for agriculture related issues, women groups for livelihood related issues, adolescent groups for child marriage or migration related issues. Through general issue discussion and introducing the objective of this project, several women and adolescents girls related issues like negligence to menstruation health, early child marriage, school drop out, early pregnancy, random child birth at home, gender based violence(especially domestic violence)  etc. Considering these issues a few mixed adult women and adolescent groups were formed and Mukti field ACV staff started organizing several workshops on gender discriminations with the help of various participatory tools supported by Rupantaran and Prajaak. 8 Adolescent girls boys and 5 women groups( total 320 groups members) got support to build their perspective on gender related issues and gradually started identifying gender discrimination in their personal life. The basic sensitization workshops also conducted among adult men groups. As a result, women started taking active role in the collective discussions making process and the woman man ratio in every meetings are nearly became 1:1 as other men are also started taking positive initiative to create a safe and non judging space for women. Adolescent groups have also started identifying their issues and through root cause analysis, they are getting a clear understanding on gender discrimination and how it impacts their lives( issues came during discussion like - restriction in higher education for girls, mobility restrictions, gender role etc)  As an outcome, Heramba Gopalpur women group joined in a community led event organized on 15th Aug 2022. For Heramba Gopalpur women group, it was the first time for them when they participated in a rally and slogan writing. In the main part of the program they also gave a speech on Independence day.     7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  Oak Progress Report.    3   During the community groups formation, we initially faced a huge political challenges as most of the group members were belong to  different vulnerable groups, the ruling party members started giving objections to conduct any meetings regarding their issues. For these political pressure, a large number of members started dropping out from the groups and refuse to take part into any discussions. At that time, the whole ACV working team started approaching to the panchayat members to join the meetings to understand the objective of this project. But due to the presence of the Panchayat members, some kind of pseudo domination in each discussion started taking places and these discussions spaces turned into a space for ruling and opponent party members and the real issues left undiscussed. In such situations a few perspective building workshops conducted by the facilitation of  ACV team among all the groups to develop the capacity of the community members as well as the Panchayat members to understand the concept of right based and community led approach and to develop the relationship between community members , ACV team members and Panchayat or other powerful stakeholders( teachers, doctors, health workers). With several set of meeting and discussion or activities ( perspective building support and module provided  by Praxis, Rupantaran, DRCSC, NCAS and Prajaak) , the groups became stable and the power influence tends to decrease over time.    In the beginning of 2nd year ( 1/07/2021),  new field staff and program coordinator were recruited who were not completely aligned with the project goal. Hence, it became a bit challenging to the ACV staff to be the facilitators and as a result, most of the proposed solutions started become partially influenced by the project staff itself such as the decisions taken by collective discussion on training topics, scheduling the meetings, issue identification etc. This challenge gradually solved with the continue handholding support of other ACV resource partners and internal staff meeting and orientation program.                          7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective Women, Youths and adolescent groups will act as change makers in the community    7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress.

Oak Progress Report.    4   Through several gender sensitization workshops, women started identifying gender discrimination in their personal and social spaces. The issues mostly addressed by the women groups are - 1. Limited scope for sharing personal opinion in the group meetings,2.Lack of confidence to talk about the violation of their basic rights(mobility, earning options, decision making, domestic violence, health related issues). The sensitization program performed by Mukti ACV field staff helped those women to understand the reason of these issues through but it takes a lot more time to develop their confidence to talk about those issues freely in front of other community members. In order to achieve the safe environment for all the women members from different communities(Farmers, daily labour, Migrant workers etc) many orientation program conducted and as a result, women started taking initiatives to raise voice against discrimination. Initiative taken by the Women collective - 1. Rally to raise awareness on gender based discrimination, slogan writing 2. Motivational speech on woman's empowerment by women members, 3. Awareness program on Menstruation Health, 4. Developing business and marketing idea for sanitary pad production 5. Started taking action on community led advocacy to avail free ambulance service(which was provided earlier and recently has been stopped by the local Govt) for the pregnant women.  Initiative taken by the Adolescents groups -  1.Both boys and girls equally participated in rally to raise awareness on  menstruation health related taboo and developing a street play group to raise awareness on early child marriage and Child labour (Adolescent boys are forced to start working to support their family from early ages and this situation increases the possibility of unsafe migration) . 2. Active role has been taken by the adolescent groups in community led advocacy on river embankment related issues to collect the required evidence.3. Adolescent groups are also planning to take initiative to reduce the negative impact of unnecessary usage of social media and extreme addiction of online gaming in the youth community.          7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  Oak Progress Report.    5     Initially we faced several challenge to mobilize the women and develop their confidence to take any initiative to raise voice against the violation of their rights and various gender based discriminations. During the 15th Aug program planning, all the woman's collective(5groups - 120 women) refused to participate actively in awareness program as they were concerned about the comments they might have received for stepping out from their home to participate in  such community events and as a result they ended up suggesting the Adolescent groups(8 groups - 100 boys and 120 girls) to attend this event to fulfill the purpose. To overcome such challenges, we requested these women groups to arrange a few meetings to talk about this issue. To resolve this,  Mukti ACV team facilitated the risk assessment process and orientation programs to develop a clear perspective about the consequences of their initiative and who and how the others will be impacted through these. With several approach, a few women from each groups convinced to take lead to mobilize other women and they successfully completed the event.  In community led advocacy group which is working on river embankment issue, several challenges were experienced by the vulnerable community representatives during the larger village level committee formation. As river embankment issue is one of the major issues in Heramba gopalpur area which is untreated by local Govt for past few years, people from most effected communities refused to talk about their issues to find a possible solution through collective discussion as they were more concern about their approach might get wrong and they will become more vulnerable. Hence a conflict created in this village level committee and they started deforming it. To resolve such issues, the objective of community led advocacy again properly defined among these committee members by the ACV facilitators and by the support of NCAS member, the committee started becoming united        7.3.a.

Oak Progress Report.    6     The communities which are relatively vulnerable based on their livelihood have been included in this initiative. The process started with several focus group discussion to understand the  current livelihood status of several communities  and the challenges they are facing right now. Through  multiple meetings,  women groups turned into the most vulnerable groups as they all are directly or indirectly involve in several livelihoods(especially farming, fishing) but don't have minimum agency over the earnings and the second most vulnerable community in Heramba Gopalpur area is the farmers community. Earning through farming became one of the unstable options as in past 4 years, people of Heramba Gopalpur experienced four disasters(Amphan, Phaani, Bulbul and Yaash) which created flooding situations in their area. This situation mostly forced the farmers community (specially male farmers with limited land) to become seasonal migrant workers to run their families. On other hand, the degree of vulnerability of this farmers community is also high due to the lack of knowledge about cropping as most of the lands are only used for monocropping so the net worth of annual produce become low as respect to the need of a farmer's family. This situation also leads most of the farmers to become a migrant workers for most of the period of time in a year. In such situation, to revive the soil condition, organic farming training has been provided to almost 300 farmers where around 30% farmers (including women and men) started making organic fertilizer and pesticides to reduce farming expenses.   And among the women and mixed groups, these groups started exploring suitable options according to their resource and abilities. Through several participatory approach, few livelihood options came up from these groups such as chicken rearing (especially native breed) indigenous seed collection and selling, crab culture , sanitary pad production, paper plate making, scented stick and candle making etc. Along with skill development training, several orientation program and marketing skill development process also going on among these groups. The training needs came up through local demand and supply chain analysis. Presently farmers groups(Women and men) and other interested members from different communities received chicken rearing training and started chicken farming in a small scale.       7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  Oak Progress Report.    7   The concept of having an additional livelihood option in their own locality is largely ignored in various communities in Sundarbans. As farming is the primary livelihood for ~85% of population in Heramba Gopalpur GP and most of the lands are used for mono cropping, for the additional income purpose, most of the people (especially male members of the family) became engage in seasonal fishing or became migrant worker for a long period of time in the year. These issues were observed during the FGD with the farmers, fisherman and daily labour groups. Through meetings and  discussion, as different additional livelihood options were introduced to these groups, mostly male members were refused to take interest for further discussion or initiatives. In such situation, the additional livelihood implementation initiative started with the women groups who are involved with different livelihood ( farming, daily labour, fishing). Through new FGH(Focus Group Discussion) , several needs emerged but also a clear demand came from the communities regarding financial and marketing support for any production related business ideas such as Pickle, Scented Sticks, Soft toys etc. Then the ACV team started taking different approach to build capacity of the communities to understand the local market demands and supply chain for developing own ideas according to the needs of the local market. To develop such capacity, several tools were given to help them understand the current market demands. Parallelly, a few orientation programs were conducted to help them understand their role to sustain their livelihood.  These all initiatives are gradually helping to eliminate the concept of dependency to third parties for raw material collection, product manufacturing and marketing.   Presently , the woman groups mapped and analyzed the basic local market demands and according to that, they have selected two livelihood options - 1. Sanitary pad manufacturing and marketing 2. Chicken rearing(native breed). Hence to establish their business, the woman groups are making strategies to overcome these challenges.    8.",

Oak Progress Report.    8 Significant Changes    1.Through out this period, several orientation training and sensitization workshops were conducted among several community members based on their caste, religion, sex, age, livelihood, social position etc. Initially during the meeting period, only a few members were actively participated in these meeting and the others people remained silent for most of the times and as our facilitators  were also not capacitated enough to manage such situation, the space that they were trying to create for all members remained limited to few community members  who are in a better social position. This scenario started changing gradually when we(the facilitators) become more equipped through participating in several capacity building workshops and we started understanding our role even better to ensure maximum active participation of all members in each group. This practice helped us create a safe space for women and adolescents. As a clear indication, a woman from the minority community shared her experience for being humiliated by all the neighbors including the panchayat members  due to her daughter refused to accept her abusive husband and chose to marry for second time. During the meeting, she shared this incident in front of all other group members and especially to the panchayat member who was present in this meeting to explain how this discriminatory behavior impacted their lives. 2. Through Participatory Action Research process, the community groups started taking initiatives in order to identify issues , analyse the issues, evidence collection, stakeholders mapping and strategy planning through adopting various  participatory approach. Through PAR, most of initiatives gradually turn into community-led with the minimal support of ACV facilitators.  3. The ACV Mukti project staff became more sensitive in respect to various sense. Before receiving any capacity building training, the facilitators were completely unaware of participatory approach. Hence in the initial meetings, the facilitators dominated the entire meeting. But over the period of time, as we were introduced to participatory approach through training and workshop, our approach to community members changed completely. From selecting the meeting dates, making the meeting agenda, any activity related planning to implementation - all are being conducted through participatory approach facilitated by the ACV field staff.                   9.

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).   In this reporting period, the adolescent and women collectives have been formed having 300 members and around 200 members respectively. Presently, the collectives are going through a cycle of perspective and skill enhancing and action. The adolescent collectives took actions on the issues identified & prioritised by them which includes survey on gender-based work division & menstruation, theater on early marriage & menstruation, rally by the young people to build public opinion on anti-trafficking issues. Women collectives have been developing the action plans, strategies and will act upon it in next grant cycle.  Another key strategy to ACV is strengthening the leadership of vulnerable groups. We developed a participatory process which was democratic as well as have reflection of values of leadership. Around 50 leaders from the vulnerable community have been identified through this process by the collectives. The skill of the leaders is being enhanced to develop leadership abilities so that they can be effective leaders. They are now planning and taking actions of issues affecting them.  In Gopalnagar GP, the VLCPC a community-based committee under the ICPS was existing, but in a dormant stage. Even few committee members were not aware of existence of such committee or they are part of such committee. A series of advocacy was conducted with panchayat authorities and block officials to activate all the 12 VLCPCs in Gopalnagar Hub by reforming the group and to include the adolescent collective members as child representative of the VLCPC. After reformation of VLCPCs along with local panchayat, we provided capacity building training of VLCPCs. Some of the VLCPCs has started identifying vulnerable children in the community, another VLCPC facilitated the process to prevent dropping out of a child from formal education.    7.1.c.

The super cyclones Yaas affected the communities in Sundarbans, devastating livelihoods and making the communities more vulnerable. Super cyclone Yaas occurred during May 2021 (before this reporting period), and the community needed recovery and restoration support, so we had to devote next few months in humanitarian support rather than focusing on implementation of the ACV project.

At Gopalnagar Hub DRCSC and Rupantaran are partnering to work, we share same workspace so that the team members of two organisations have better bonding and an opportunity to learn and co-create.  Gender issues has been identified as one of the major issues by the vulnerable communities in each of the micro level plans. To work effectively on the issue, the need for gender perspective building emerged out of the project implementing teams of different hubs. Based on the need, a perspective building workshop on gender issues was organised by Rupantaran. The workshop facilitated the basic understanding of the socialisation process of Gender, the marginalisation of girls and women within the family, gender-based violence and how gender norms affect men. Feedback was conducted where the participants shared, they have applied the learnings of the workshop in not just in their professional lives, their organisation but also challenged patriarchy in their personal lives.  ISWS one of the partners in ACV, implementing the project at Digambarpur Hub were facing challenge in facilitating the different collectives they have formed, especially with adolescents. Based on their needs, Rupantaran provided one day training on basic facilitation skill to the project implementation team of ISWS and provided handholding support for building gender lens in their programme.  BTS one of the partners in ACV, implementing the project at Achintanagar Hub shared that they are facing challenge in discussing the issues of domestic violence with the collective members and require support for the same. Accordingly, Rupantaran provided one day training to the womens collective leaders as well as project implementation team of BTS on domestic violence. The training was followed up with a discussion on implementation plan with the project implementation team of BTS.    7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles.

As we began implementing this revised approach, we saw better engagement with the community and our improved ability to elicit more meaningful responses from our audience that will be helpful in driving the desired behavior change. Summary of progress on project outcomes: 1. Trained 12 youth leaders on new communication strategy  Re-designed our communication strategy to focus on rights, barriers and gender using a behavioral change approach (details in 7.1.c).  Conducted four-day residential training followed by three-day practice for youth leaders and their supervisor.  Youth leaders initiated community outreach using participatory interactions to make young people more active participants in their own behavior change. 2. Oriented 9,410 young women and 7,640 young men on life skills, rights, and gender Young women  Engaged with young women with focus on SRH rights, barriers faced in exercising these rights and their aspirations for change.  The sessions sparked interest among young women and led to provoking questions  on curbs on movement or clothing choices unlike male counterparts, on restrictions during menstruation, and around other practices that make them uncomfortable. The discussions set the foundation for subsequent rounds that will build their skills to communicate these issues with adults and partners.  Promoted our AI-powered chatbot (Disha Didi) and conducted SRH sessions in schools reaching 1,800 girls. Young men  Conducted sessions with men on relevant SRH information, particularly contraception, and emphasized their role in supporting women's SRH.  Used an interactive game to emphasize the connection between reproductive health and finances. This encouraged discussions on the importance of family planning giving segway  Oak Progress Report.    3 to deeper discussions  including adopting safe sexual practices and using contraception themselves for the benefits it brings to their relationships and families. Also conducted couple counselling with non-users of contraceptive  youth leaders reported that 2,100 of 2,700 couples have adopted a modern contraceptive (self-reported), with nearly 55% using condom. 3. Sensitized 1,840 family members on supporting young womens SRH Sensitized mothers and mothers-in-law on SRH-related barriers that came up during discussions with young women. While a lot of these emanated from long-held beliefs and traditionally followed practices, they also include common misconceptions that hinder adoption of healthy SRH practices by young women  youth leaders addressed these during their sessions. 4. Strengthened two public health facilities to offer youth friendly SRH services Oriented all relevant staff in intervention facilities (four CAC providers and two counsellors) on provisions of the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021 and provision of youth-responsive SRH services, including abortions to young women. 5. Strengthened six HWCs to offer SRH services and referral  Based on district officials request, conducted district-level contraceptive training for 10 community health officers (CHOs) to expand their role in contraceptive service provision  the training was attended by the civil surgeon and other officials, who appreciated the training.  Conducted virtual orientation for 20 CHOs and a telemedicine hub doctor for initiating provision of injectable contraceptive through eSanjeevani (federal governments telemedicine program).  Conducted facility strengthening, including provision of equipment, facilitating IEC materials, strengthening documentation, and introduction to the referral mechanism.  Strengthened six sub centres in the catchment area as referral points  we oriented relevant staff on SRH and referral mechanism and facilitated display of IEC material.       Our complementary efforts at the community and facility levels facilitated provision of SRH services to 14,375 young women. Please refer Annexure 1 for break-up by age group and type of service provided. 6. Developed a robust evaluation plan with comprehensive exit indicators with comprehensive additional exit indicators. Please refer Annexure 2 for details. Refer Annexure 3 for a compilation of project pictures.    7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Key learnings and insights:  Communication strategy  Developed in collaboration with a social and behavior change communication consultant, the revised communication strategy emphasizes on key principles  rights, power, space, participation and inclusion  and works to address key factors that influence behavior, including social norms, beliefs and values. The youth leaders are on a learning curve implementing these newer concepts in the community, and  Oak Progress Report.    4 we are continuously adapting and refining the strategy (including combining modules) based on their experience and learnings.  Working with the SRH framework  The revised strategy meant a major shift in the community engagement approach of youth leaders, with focus on understanding the target audience's attitudes, beliefs, and motivators, and working on changing SRH-related behaviors keeping these in mind. This approach brought forth unanticipated responses from the communities, including seeking solutions for structural barriers (such as movement restrictions) and other allied issues (like child marriage). This in turn has meant more intense mentorship by IDF to equip youth leaders to manage such conversations. Keeping this in view, we have planned periodic capacity building of youth leaders to enable them to effectively moderate such conversations and offer support/referrals.  Prevailing attitudinal barriers among providers  We introduced a tool  an adaptation of Ipass Stigmatizing Attitudes, Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS)  to measure health staffs attitudes, perceptions and stigma related to abortion and contraception. The tool comprises of 25 statements that the respondent rates on a Likert scale which is used to measure three important dimensions, negative stereotyping, exclusion and discrimination, and fear of contagion from those who associate with abortion and contraception. The tool helped us discover prevailing negative beliefs and attitudes that hinder service provision  such as women who use birth spacing may become promiscuous or having an abortion may become a habit for women  that we will work on addressing.  Safe spaces  Youth leaders created six safe spaces in anganwadi centres and schools to provide young girls an environment where they could have confidential and non-judgmental conversations about SRH; these were visited by over 560 young women and girls. While we received a positive response, we recognized the limitation of this approach with dependence on youth leaders and the spaces themselves not being accessible by young girls independently. We are re-visiting this and will test an approach where the safe space facilitates unrestricted access  for example, creating online forums to facilitate these conversations, encouraging leadership by the yuva saathis who can work with their peers to identify other such spaces and facilitate these conversations.    7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective Strengthen an enabling environment supportive for adolescent girls and young women (ages 10-24 years) to meet their SRH needs in four existing intervention areas of Magrahat 1, Mathurapur 1, Mathurapur 2, Kulpi in West Bengal    7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Using the revamped strategy (similar to objective 1), we focused on nurturing a supportive environment for young women and adolescent girls. Our youth leaders reached adolescents and young women with rights-based SRH information through community and school sessions, nurtured support of community gatekeepers, and worked on normalizing SRH conversations at the  Oak Progress Report.    5 community and family levels. Complementing this, we decentralized SRH services to lower-level facilities and initiated capacity building of community-based young volunteers, yuva saathis. Summary of progress on project outcomes: 1. Oriented 3,620 adolescents (10-19 years) and 1,260 young women on life skills, rights, and gender Adolescents  Youth leaders provided age-appropriate SRH information, especially the negative impact of early marriage and pregnancy on their health and lives.  Along with foundational conversations on rights, emphasized on positive body image and self-esteem, respecting personal boundaries and the importance of open communication with parents, peers, and healthcare providers on SRH issues.  Adolescents are more comfortable talking about SRH  they are vocal about their concerns during sessions with youth leaders and are active during community events (like world population day) doing rallies, role plays, discussions on SRH etc that indicates this groups improved confidence and engagement with SRH issues. Young women  Introduced them to the rights-based framework, with emphasis on delivering SRH information in a manner that is more relatable and resonates with them to facilitate behavior change.  Through case studies and role plays, fostered understanding of the practical aspects of contraception, and decision making processes involved in choosing and using contraception. We learnt of a young woman who reported how the role play during the youth leaders session gave her ideas on having a conversation with her mother-in-law that helped initiate contraceptive use.        Please click the link Khadija's diary by ipasdevelopmentfoundation - Issuu for a representative case. 2. Sensitized 1,300 family members to play a supportive role Sensitized mothers and mothers-in-law on SRH, especially addressing misconceptions highlighted by young women, ranging from contraception being unnatural and causing weight gain or use of contraception impacting womens fertility. We also facilitated joint meetings with their daughters-in-law emphasizing the adverse consequences of teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortions, and encouraging them to support young girls for SRH-related care. 3. Sensitized 25 PRI members and 25 SHG members on SRH To garner support for young womens SRH, youth leaders oriented key community gatekeepers on our intervention and the importance of SRH for young women. They have been helpful in addressing on-ground issues during community events and have supported youth leaders in influencing family members. 4. Strengthened four public health facilities and associated Anwesha clinics for SRH  Oriented four providers and three Anwesha counsellors in the intervention facilities on the amended abortion law, including providing a handout for reference.  Streamlined supply of injectable contraceptives by liasoning with the state FP nodal officer.  The period witnessed irregular services by counselors due to long leave or charge of additional facilities. In such situations, counsellors relied on IDF youth leaders for reaching adolescents with SRH information and referring them to service providers.  Oak Progress Report.    6  Identified some misconceptions using the SABAS tool such as IUCD can cause cancer, and biases among providers against women who have an abortion. 5. Strengthened eight HWCs to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services/referrals.  Initiated and streamlined contraceptive provision through eSanjeevani by training on contraceptives (focus on long-acting reversible contraceptives) for 8 ANMs and 8 CHOs and a telemedicine hub doctor[1].  Strengthened four sub centres in the catchment area as referral points by orienting relevant staff on SRH and referral linkages. We facilitated provision of SRH services to over 53,000 young women, including 16,116 adolescent girls. Please refer Annexure 1 for details. 6. Developed a robust evaluation plan with comprehensive exit indicators with comprehensive additional exit indicators. Please refer Annexure 2 for details. In addition, as part of our efforts to disseminate and implement amendments to the MTP Act & Rules in the state, using alternate funds, we:  Conducted state-level dissemination of the MTP Act amendments with participation of senior state officials, 49 district officials and 28 CAC master trainers.  Conducted district-level orientation of district and block medical health officers of Diamond Harbour district.  Facilitated constitution of Medical Board at Medical College & Hospital Diamond Harbour for late-term abortions. [1] IDF led this initiative at the state level through alternate funding    7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Key learnings and shortcomings:  Yuva Saathis  Working with youth leaders, we identified 20 girls from the community to be yuva saathis to provide peer support, lead community-based efforts and be the social capital that the project leaves behind (in addition to the youth leaders themselves). IDF led the initial batch of training with support from selected youth leaders and conducted two rounds of training  a technical session on SRH, followed by skill building in areas such as effective communication, active listening, facilitation and group management and engaging peers to identify SRHR barriers. This experience has been both challenging yet rewarding  it required us to continuously tailor the training (considering their prior knowledge and experience of SRH, cultural background etc) and be patient, creative and adaptive to varying rates of learning. However, the energy, enthusiasm to learn, and willingness of yuva saathis to work on the issue and support communities was incredibly fulfilling, and kept us motivated.  We were unable to reach a strategic alignment with the organization for sustainable supply of low-priced sanitary napkins.    Oak Progress Report.    7  7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective Adapt and expand the adolescent and youth-focused SRH model in three blocks in Sunderbans, West Bengal    7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  In Year 1, we laid the foundation for our intervention by conducting a community survey and facility-level assessment to identify gaps and better understand the needs of our target audience. We strengthened the capacity of healthcare providers and community intermediaries to provide youth-responsive services and streamlined SRH services, especially at health and wellness centers for improved access. With this strong foundation and our outcome indicators in place, we are now prepared to focus our community-based efforts to improve SRH behaviors and practices. 1. Selected intervention areas for community interventions: Working in consultation with district and block health officials, we selected six gram panchayats covering 23 villages in the three intervention blocks for community outreach activities prioritizing panchayats that were further from health facilities and had poor service access. We also selected three facilities  RH Rudranagar, RH Dwariknagar and RH Madhabnagar  for facility-level interventions. 2. Conducted community-based assessment: To assess knowledge, behavior, practices and access barriers that young women and adolescents face, we conducted a cross-sectional community survey with 767 respondents (including adolescent girls, young women and men) in the three intervention blocks. Some key findings:  Young women and girls have high level of stigma, myths, and misconceptions related to SRH issues  most of them around menstruation (69%) and abortion (54%)  Agency is low  irrespective of marital status, young women and girls majorly rely on others to take decisions on education, marriage, healthcare, and pregnancy.  They have poor negotiating ability  more than one fourth adolescents reported poor ability to negotiate with parents regarding continuing education or time of marriage.  About one third of male respondents reported having a positive outlook towards womens SRH. 3. Developed outcome indicators: Based on the community assessment and our understanding of the current challenges, we determined outcome indicators and the expected level of change we anticipate by the project end. Please refer Annexure 2 for the indicator list. 4. Strengthened three IDF intervention facilities and associated Anwesha clinics to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services:  Facilitated CAC training for two doctors in RH Dwariknagar and one doctor in Madhabnagar.  Oak Progress Report.    8  Conducted onsite orientations in two facilities, orienting 24 facility staff including doctors, nursing staff and counsellors, with a focus on adolescent and youth specific SRH and the important role each of them play in facilitating SRH access.  Introduced relevant staff to the referrals by community health intermediaries; provided leaflets in the Anwesha clinics for distribution and reference aids for counselors. 5. Strengthened six HWCs to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services and referrals: a. Needs assessment: Conducted needs assessment in six HWCs, key observations:  Except one, all HWCs had a community health officer (CHO) in place  Facility staff reported/demonstrated gaps in technical knowledge on contraception, and had not had any orientation on youth-friendly services  While most HWCs followed waste management protocol, there were major gaps in infection prevention, documentation and IEC on FP/adolescent health  Sub-optimal SRH service provision b. Capacity building:  Initiated injectable contraceptive (first dose) at five HWCs through eSanjeevani (telemedicine)  Conducted centralized training for ANMs from all six HWCs with sessions on modern contraceptives, including model and hands-on practice on IUCD insertion; amendments to the abortion law; adolescent SRH issues; and provision of youth-responsive services. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer Health attended the training and emphasized on teenage pregnancy urging participants to focus on newly married young couples for delaying pregnancy. c. Other support: Provided FP and SRH registers and oriented relevant staff on documentation; facilitated display of IEC material on adolescent SRH and technical posters (such as infection prevention) and provided reference aids for providers (including handout on contraceptive methods and decision-making tool for contraception) 6. Sensitized 169 community intermediaries to needs of adolescents and young women: Sensitized community intermediaries through block-level orientations. The pre-test highlighted attitudinal barriers  more than 80% believed that providing contraception and abortion information would mislead adolescents, that contraception should not be used before first pregnancy and that emergency contraceptive was for married women only. Over the next reporting period, as we initiate community outreach, we will focus efforts on addressing gaps in knowledge and garnering their support for adolescent SRH issues.    7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Key learnings and insights:  The project provided an improved understanding of the on-ground realities of the health system in the selected Sunderbans area. Service providers are non-committal and often tend to be non-supportive; there are huge gaps in technical knowledge and skills of facility staff; and documentation and recording is poor. The lack of effective monitoring due to the  Oak Progress Report.    9 remote location and the slow pace of work has resulted in interrupted service availability, which is further exacerbated for SRH services for young women. This provides us a huge opportunity to plug existing gaps and improve provision of regular SRH services for young women.  We identified prevailing contraception-related beliefs among health facility staff using the SABAS tool  newly married couples do not require contraception and prolonged use of contraception can cause health hazards/make woman infertile. We will be addressing these in our follow-up interactions with the staff members   8.",

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Praajaks work focuses on strengthening CBOs working in Sunderbans, to enable them integrate working on gender & child protection issues within their existing works. Over the last year the CBOs have been have been equipped with the knowledge and perspectives to identify and address issues of gender-based violence and violations of child rights within the communities they are working with through trainings. The CBOs have initiated outreach activities within women & children in the communities which is helping them understand the different gender & child protection issues in the communities that needs to be addressed. The CBOs, limited to working with men of the communities on livelihood issues are now expanding their works with women & children in the communities. Women, children & adolescents from the communities are also coming out for the first time as they find a platform to speak about themselves, share their concerns. Incidents of gender-based violence, violence against children are being reported with increased interactions of CBOs with women & children. This generated a need within CBOs to equip themselves to deal with such situations of violence and accordingly training plans were made with Praajak. Since dealing with cases require different systems and mechanisms to be in place, discussions on setting up organizational policies & systems were initiated. Thus, the management of the organizations have been part of discussions and planning on the development of child protection policies so as to ensure proper reporting mechanisms & handling of cases. The outreach activities are leading to formation of women and adolescent groups and there is a move towards collectivisation and working with the collectives, identifying leaders & developing leadership skills.      7.1.c.

Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. This being an explorative initiative, the implementing partners being new to the process, it took time for the activities to take shape. The pandemic was yet another challenge as all the initiatives that were undertaken had to be stalled and reworked upon in the last year. Praajak along with the CBOs were unable to meet the initial plans and there was almost a years gap when the process could be initiated.  Oak Progress Report.    3 The concepts of gender and child protection being new to the CBOs, it remained confined to the project activities with limited engagement from the management to further the issue within the organizations. This took time but gradually the process has been initiated as mentioned earlier.    7.2.a.

The work was initiated with each CBO separately so as to arrive at goals to work with. But gradual progression saw CBOs coming together for different trainings and orientation processes as there were certain common needs emerging. But the collaborative phase has just been initiated with joint training, orientations and the subsequent discussions at formal and informal plains, where CBOs are discussing collaborations with different stakeholders, collaborations among themselves for effective implementation of the programs. CBOs are in the process of identifying stakeholders within the communities to work with. Thus, there is a focus on understanding participation which would be the foundation of co-operation and collaboration between the CBOs and with the various stakeholders.   Accordingly various discussions on participatory approaches, methods of communication, needs of collaboration are being organized with the CBOs. The community groups formed by the organizations are seen to be actively engaged with planning and implementing different activities within the communities.    7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. The existing works of the organizations are mostly done in top-down approaches and hence issues of co-operation, collaboration and community participation is new to them. Thus it has taken time for the issue of collectivisation and collective ownership take shape. Working with gender based violence and child protection need active community participation, co-operation and collaboration with other stakeholders. Identification of stakeholders and ways of collaborations was initially challenging as organizations are not adequately equipped with ways to ensure active participations of stakeholders, including women and children.

Objective 1 Objective  Oak Progress Report.    2 To advocate for health system strengthening for improving access to rights-based SRH services including comprehensive abortion care in Kalchini and Kolkata districts.  FPA India has been providing SRH information and services in the aforementioned operational areas of Kalchini and Kolkata. Based on the steady increase in footfalls to the clinics of FPA India, or the number of beneficiaries reached through community-based interventions, there is a sustained need for SRH interventions. The public health infrastructure within the operational areas is also reliant upon the FPAI teams for last-mile service delivery (Kalchini), or to conduct male sterilization procedures (Kolkata). Ever since the onset of the pandemic, FPAI has received requests to increase the range of services provided (especially in Kalchini) and expand services to newer geographies (particularly in Kolkata). Through this objective, it is proposed to increase resource allocation, optimize the utilization of available resources and improve the capacities of health care providers for improving access.       7.1.b. Objective 1 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  An expansion of SRH Programme for Indigent Populations' Rights and Empowerment. The Project ASPIRE supported by Oak Foundation is being implemented in West Bengal through FPA Indias Kalchini and Kolkata Branches. It aims to expand access to sexual and reproductive health and empower individuals and communities to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights with gender equality, economic empowerment and thus poverty alleviation. The project has been implemented in West Bengal through FPA Indias Kalchini branch located in north of Bengal and FPA India Kolkata branch which is catering to the population of south Bengal. Under the project, FPA India Kalchini branch has expanded the geographical reach with SRH care in Madarihat block of Alipurduar District. The Satellite clinic established by FPA India in Madarihat under one of the specially funded projects for comprehensive abortion care was closed down after the funding was stopped, with Oak Foundations partial grant support, this clinic has been revamped with the staff, commodities, and maintenance. It is now being accessed by the people in and around Madarihat block. This block is divided into a diverse culture of different communities like Bengali, Nepali, Muslim, Adivasi, Rava, Mech, Garo & Toto, having their origin back to different places in India. The services provided at the Satellite clinic are being accessed by these communities and referral for SRH care has been done with FPA Indias Kalchini RHFPC.  With an expansion under ASPIRE project, Kalchini branch has taken up 17 new tea gardens in Madarihat and also covering 9 new tea gardens in Kalchini block which were not regularly covered due to accessibility issues. The expansion is estimated to cover an additional 2,50,000 population together. FPA India Kolkata branch has been working in urban, peri-urban areas covering slum population in and around Kolkata including Howrah, Hooghly as well as parts of Sunderbans closer to the satellite clinics of FPA India Kolkata branch near Lake garden, Topsia and Rajarhat. Under ASPIRE project, it intervenes in south Bengal through to 5 selected blocks of Sunderbans, i.e. Basanti, Canning, Gosaba, Kultoli in 24 south Parganas and Hingalganj block in north 24 Parganas. With an expansion in 24 Parganas, Kolkata would be reaching out to approximately 8,00,000 new population over the period of project. Expansion includes working with women, men, transgender population, female and male sex workers  in selected areas of key population such as Sonagachi.    Oak Progress Report.    3 Understanding the health needs and capacities. Kalchini: To understand the communities health needs, social heath determinants and current capacities of the existing healthcare system, Kalchini conducted 7 FGDs with ASHAs, ANMs, AWWs, PRI members, Tea garden health service providers and tea garden community members. The findings indicated the need of clinical training to the current service providers for sexual and reproductive health. There is no apprehension amongst the community members for accessing services at the public health facility however, public health facilities and tea garden hospitals are not equipped with the staff and commodities.  It is resulting in either people ignoring the health needs or availing health services at the private health facilities. Most of the tea garden hospitals in the selected intervention areas are non-functional and some tea gardens in Kalchini are accessed by the community but these hospitals are largely dependent on external sources like FPA India for commodities and services. Kolkata (Sunderbans): In Sunderbans however, in depth interviews were conducted with local women along with 26 FGDs with local women and mens groups, frontline workers, PRI members because it was completely new intervention area taken by FPA India for SRH care. The healthcare infrastructure in Sunderbans in selected 5 blocks was found to be fragmented largely because of its locale which poses difficulty in accessing the islands. Institutionalized health care is either non-existent or inadequate. This leaves healthcare choices for the people of these areas limited to indigenous healthcare providers using herbal medicinal supplements from forest resources and private healthcare providers which demand out of pocket expenses. There is a question on the qualifications of the private health care providers as well. Both the branches have started their interventions in the selected areas, however building rapport and increasing accessibility may take time for focused SRH intervention especially to avail safe abortion care and services related to gender based violence. Advocacy and networking with key stakeholders for health system strengthening. Health systems and polices have a critical role in determining the manner in which health services are delivered, utilized, and affect health outcomes. Health is a state matter and therefore, to influence the systems for positive outcomes, FPA India works in close partnerships with central and most state governments. With respect to West Bengal, FPA India is a Member in various district level committees like District Health & Family Welfare Samiti (Executive Member), District Task Force Meeting (Executive Committee Member), District MTP Committee (Executive Committee Member), Block Health & Family Welfare Committee, kalchini (Executive Committee Member) and Block Disaster Committee-Kalchini and Kolkata (Member) and the representative of FPA India from Kalchini and Kolkata participate in the meetings being held by these committee heads on regular basis. The Kalchini branch also attends regular district MIS meetings organized by the health department to understand the progress, to review the available resources with district authority and provide recommendations with district level policy makers. During the reporting period, 12 meetings were conducted at district level which were attended by FPA India representative. Issues related to safe abortion services and budget for Palaki ambulance project in Buxa Dooars were discussed during these meetings and forwarded to State NHM.  As a result of previous series of meetings in this regard and participation in 12 meetings during the reporting period, Buxa Dooars Palaki ambulance project is sanctioned in District and state PIP by NHM.   The Palaki ambulance is an initiative by FPA India as a public private partnership model (PPP) with health Alipurduar district health department to transport pregnant women and persons in need of facility based emergency and other Medical care, including, Institutional delivery and other general health, from the terrain of the Buxa Dooars to the nearest Govt. Hospital. The Palaki is being used with support of volunteers of FPA India and local people. It has been equipped with informative materials on protection of girl child, institutional delivery and other SRH issues. It operates or twenty four hours per day, seven days a week, providing a Basic  Oak Progress Report.    4 Life Support (BLS) medical care. Palki Ambulance has made a positive impact on pregnant women and the local populace and has been recognized by district health system as a best practice. Capacity building of health care providers. Kalchini: Kalchini branch conducted following meetings to plan capacity building trainings for SRH care for the Government health care Providers during the reporting period:  Madarihat Rural Hospital under Madarihat Gram Panchayet which was attended by BMHO, MOs, GNMS- ANMS and 36 ASHAs from Madarihat.  Meetings with Birpara State General Hospital were attended by Superintendent, Mo and other staff.  MOs and GNMs of Sisujhumra PHC, Sisubari PHC, Totopara PHC also attended the meetings organized for them to initiate the discussion for SRH trainings. Kolkata:  One training on SRH care was conducted in Bharatghar Nursing Home in basanti by Kolkata branch for the clinical and para medical staff. Apart from the nursing home staff,  7 private medical practitioners from the Kochukhali and Satjalia gram panchayats in Gosaba block attended 1 SRH training each.  Kolkata branch conducted one meeting with the Basanti Gramin Hospital which was attended by BMOH and other staff. The focus of the meeting was SRH training and smooth referral for general health care. It will need subsequent meetings and follow-up to train the staff to provide the SRH care.  For the partnership with private health care providers, 2 RMOs, 30 on call doctors and 18 staff nurses from the private hospitals in Birpara are at the discussion stage, trainings will be conducted, and partnership will be formalized with them in the 2nd phase.  A total of 182 ASHAs and 56 ANMS have been sensitized by Kalchini branch for SRH care. Mobilizing champions to advocate for SRHR. Kalchini: Total 19 mothers clubs were formed in newly selected tea gardens by Kalchini branch wherein 190 new women members were included in the group of network for SRHR and mitigation of gender based violence. Members of the Mothers Club are community-based volunteers who work towards community empowerment.   Kolkata:  FPA Indias intervention in Kolkata has resulted in formation of total 35 womens groups comprise of 275 members across 15 gram panchayats. All the groups have attended at least 1 session each on gender based violence and sexual reproductive health care. These groups will be further strengthened to address the violence as well as to sensitize the young people from the community on SRH and GBV issues.  Total 27 meetings were conducted for sensitization on SRHR and GBV with these groups. The formal trainings will be conducted subsequently to strengthen the capacities for advocating for the rights of women.   Kolkata branch has appointed 6 new link workers in Sunderbans in 2023, along with them,  local ASHAs and ANMS were mobilized through total 50 + meetings during the reporting period to sensitize about SRH care. Total 9 SRH trainings were conducted for these frontline workers.   Oak Progress Report.    5   7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  The local district authorities rely on the FPAI team in Kalchini to deliver last mile contraceptive supplies and immunization services to needy populations in hilly terrains where there are no motorable roads or government health facilities. While the intervention by FPA India helps to build partnership with Government, it consumes lot of resources in order to make health care available and accessible to the most needy population.  It is challenging to get cooperation of BDOs for capacity building and interventions in Sunderbans with health facilities as they expect approval from dept of Sunderbans affairs or state government to implement activities. However, local administration like panchayat members are cooperative and provide support to the team.  The selected intervention areas of Sunderbans are financial and human resource consuming. The meetings in regard to advocacy and partnership with government officials for capacity building, trainings of grassroot level staff, doctors, and strengthening the hospital systems etc.  require participation of experienced and senior staff at the initial stage. These areas are geographically hard to reach and in order to return to the cities after intervention, teams need to adhere to timings of transports available. Hence, simultaneously meetings and service delivery become difficult to cover both service delivery and advocacy aspects hence it also results in delay/ slow progress.    Currently there is no programme implementation plan being directly implemented as per the budget at district level. District health administration has been collecting information through the meetings conducted with public health officials and other partners where the issues of implementation and special project budgets are being discussed. However, as the PIP of 2022-2024 is already done and revision will be done in 2023, there is no action, directive suggested so far. The 1st scope to put forward the suggestions would come in the mid- review meeting.   While most of the Tea garden hospitals are defunct, the staff is present in the hospital and many of them have not undergone any clinical training for a long time. This training will be conducted at the later stage when funds for commodities are strengthened at the tea garden level to ensure that the staff undergone training have sufficient commodities and resources to provide these services.     7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective To empower adolescents, young women, and key population groups from vulnerable and/or marginalized communities with life skills and income generation opportunities in a gender-just environment. This objective attempts to address norm change through gender-transformative interventions to support GBV survivors; create an enabling environment that pre-empts gender-based violence and supports the rehabilitation of survivors, and works towards primary prevention of GBV and transitioning of adolescents into responsible citizens through comprehensive sexuality education.     Oak Progress Report.    6  7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Mobilizing young voices. Kalchini: During the reporting period, FPA India Kalchini branch formed total 6 new youth groups in Madarihat block, which has been selected for an expansion. The groups have a total of 66 youth members from Gopalpur, Tulsipara, Singhania, Dalmore and Dumchipara. On forming the groups youth members were oriented about the project and participated in the sensitization meetings conducted for them on gender-based violence, SRH and youth and safe abortion care. Kolkata: Kolkata branch formed 30 new groups in Sunderbans with young people across 5 blocks. The initial work with young people had started in the areas which are connected to city by road like Basanti and Canning. The branch originally had some contacts in Basanti with CBOs and other Kolkata based NGOs who work in Basanti block on various issues. These earlier collaborations helped the team to build the rapport with young people during the initial health camps conducted in the villages of Basanti block.  Out of total 30 groups formed; 13 groups of 55 young people are formed in Basanti block followed by Hingalganj in north 24 parganas which is an isolated block. Together in Jogeshganj and Sahenkhali of Hingalganj, there are total 7 groups formed with 34 young people. These groups are at the initial phase and in some areas,  the group is as small as 2 members at present. However, these young people help the teams in mobilization, accompany them in case of meetings with stake holders etc. gradually they are expected to expand the group with their peers. Capacity building and connecting dots for partnership. Kalchini:  FPA India Kalchini has a partnership developed with Birpara Welfare Organization for the referrals of clients for livelihood skills learning. In the reporting year, total 8 gender-based survivors identified from the Madarihat areas were sent to Birpara Organization who attended tailoring course.  FPA India has initiated the partnership with NGO Pratham, a grantee NGO of Oak Foundation for referrals of GBV survivors from north Bengal intervention areas to avail life skills and alternative livelihood opportunities. A pilot batch of identified GBV survivors will be sent to Pratham and clients will be followed up for the retention of job opportunities provided to them by Pratham on completion of the course.   Kolkata:  In Sunderbans meetings have been conducted with community members to understand the livelihood options and women and young people from the community, have suggested few options like bee-hiving, local spices and flowers business etc. However, it has been seen by the community members as an opportunity for income generation in general and not specific to the women survivors of gender based violence. The concept of gender-based violence within the family and peripheries take time to shape up and communities in Sundarbans are going through the process of it and at initial phase.   Another oak Grantee, Liver Foundation, has planned their intervention in Sunderbans and 3 meetings have been conducted with Liver Foundation for the partnership. This partnership will result in training the volunteers of Liver foundation in SRH and gender-based violence who can further provide the care in the community.   Oak Progress Report.    7 Comprehensive sexuality education for young people Kalchini:  In north Bengal, through FPA Indias comprehensive Sexuality education programme total 61 sessions were conducted in Madarihat through which 3,948 young adolescent boys and girls from schools were sensitized, these participants were from class 7th to 11th.  For the out of school adolescents such 37 sessions were conducted on Relationship, Communication Skill, HIV/AIDS, Safe Abortion, GBV, RTI, Contraception which reached out to 949 young people Kolkata:  In Sunderbans the SCEs were conducted in the 8 schools. Total 350  school going children attended the CSE sessions as follows: Basanti ( 108 children), Goasaba ( 81 children), Kultoli ( 55 children) and Hingalganj ( 106 children).  While partnerships with schools are taking shape in Sunderbans, the intervention in the community via CSE sessions has much progressed. Total 64 sessions on CSEs were conducted across 5 intervention blocks which reached out to 1,220 young people. The response for these sessions in the community is highest in Kultoli block.  The community strategy is also helping to build the rapport with parents and bringing young people together to advocate for SRHR. Taking the onus, capacity building of teachers for CSE Kalchini: To build capacities of the schoolteachers to conduct comprehensive abortion sessions for the adolescents, total 5 teacher trainings were conducted in north Bengals schools which were attended by 63 teachers across 28 schools. On completing the ToT, total 35 sessions were conducted by the newly trained teachers in the schools.   FPA India Kalchini branchs presence in Madarihat with comprehensive abortion care services is resulting in healthy partnerships with other stakeholders well. Kolkata: Total 8 ToTs were conducted by Kolkata branch for 40 teachers across 4 blocks except Canning. The response to initiate the training independently was not very positive in Sunderbans. A top-down approach may work, but it wont have the onus from the schools for sustained intervention which has been observed in Kalchini.      7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. It is challenging to get cooperation of BDOs for capacity building and interventions in Sunderbans with health facilities as they expect formal health and family welfare department, West Bengal to implement any activities. At present, the blocks selected under Sunderbans have weak public health facilities and it is a new geography for FPAI, hence, for the participation of ASHAs, AWWs, school staff is taking time without formal approvals. While some of the ASHAs are very cooperative and supporting during the health sessions being conducted, organizing capacity building trainings with them in a big group at a time is difficult. However, local administration like panchayat members are cooperative and provide support to the team and with their help it will be taken up.  Oak Progress Report.    8    7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective To strengthen access to a comprehensive range of quality SRH services through clinic and outreach-based models of service delivery, leveraging technology and partnerships in new and existing operational areas under FPA India Kalchini and Kolkata Branches.    7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Strengthening the access to sexual and reproductive health care: Outcome of satellite clinic under the project in North Bengal (Kalchini):  Total 6,338 new clients registered at the Satellite clinic at Madarihat and availed the SRH care.  Total 557 women availed the management of medical abortion during the reporting period.   Total 157 new users received 10 years intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) at Satellite clinic which accounts to 6% contribution to the total IUCD insertion to women in the reporting period by Kalchini branch.  557 new women and 20,366 continued users availed the oral pills through Satellite clinic as a family planning method.  2,626 women were screened for gender-based violence and provided counselling. Strengthening the access to sexual and reproductive health care: Reaching out to unreached- the outreach intervention Kolkata intervention: The service delivery model for Sunderbans by Kolkata branch is through outreach based special service sessions. During the reporting period, the team provided general health and sexual reproductive health care to total 8,745 people out of which 4,742 were women, mainly from reproductive age group. The two most critical islands which FPA India has taken up under this project: Chota Mulla Khali and Kumirbari, provided health services to 570 people in just two outreach camps which shows the need of health services in that area. Total 293 women benefitted through 2 camps on these islands. Apart from common ailments and anemia, issues like white discharge, irregular menstruation were found to be common amongst women.  These islands are away from the land and Hospital accessibility to Canning is not just cost extensive but also has limited transportation options.  However, Chota Mulla Khali has a PHC in semi functional state where delivery facility is also available.  So far, multiple meetings have been conducted with stakeholders in Chota mulla Khali, and the local leaders and members on village committee have shown willingness to work around health issues of people living on these islands.  FPA India Kolkata will be building capacities of the Hospital staff to provide sexual and reproductive services in subsequent phases which will help both the island to avail health services at low cost and with regular intervals.  Oak Progress Report.    9 For FPA India Kolkata, the 1st year of intervention was crucial to build rapport in selected blocks of 24 Parganas. The capacity building of existing health facilities and health care providers for sexual reproductive care is a long process, hence, while the team was parallelly working around collating data, building rapport with health facilities, establishing contacts with various local CBOs and frontline workers, there were multiple visits conducted to the intervention blocks with the team of doctors and para medical staff to provide the health care in the outreach camps. The team conducted total 44 outreach health service sessions in the villages of selected 5 GPs ( 10 in Basanti, 9 in Gosaba, 11 in Kultoli, 5 in Canning, and 9 in Hingalganj)  with general health and sexual reproductive health care provision which benefitted total 8,745 people. 54 % of the population who availed services were women. The branch also conducted 5 special service sessions in the high need areas of female sex workers at Sonagachi, Tollugunj and Rambagan reaching out to 430 women, 65 men and 3 children from key population. While these sessions were focused on sexual and reproductive health, general health care was also provided on demand. Kalchini intervention in outreach: During the reporting period with support from Oak Foundation grant and FPA Indias initiatives, total 49 health service sessions were conducted in new intervention area which were combined health sessions for general health and sexual reproductive health care. Total 2,223 community members availed the services out of which 1,471 (66%) were women in reproductive age groups, 533 (24 %) were men and remaining 219 were children under 14 years.  The outcomes of all Service delivery points: RHFPC, Satellite clinics, Associate clinics, CBDs and Outreach for Kalchini and Kolkata: The following table[i] depicts collated impact of the SRH intervention done by FPA Indias Kolkata and Kalchini branches.

There is 7% increase in the uptake of SRH services by vulnerable and underserved communities in the intervention areas. Total 2, 95, 582 additional services were provided together by Kalchini and Kolkata compared to the baseline which are reported as per the quality service guidelines.  We are expecting 7-10  % increase every year in the uptake of SRH services by expanding the geography in the most needy areas.   While the number of abortions provided by RHFPCs has increased by 25%, there is a 19% decline in the Associated clinic performance. On the ground of noncompliance of the quality- Oak Progress Report.    11 of-care norms, some associated clinics data is not included as per the decision in data collection methodology taken by FPA India. More details on this are available in the",
        "Significant changes": "significant changes section. While there was a good response to reopening of satellite clinic, there is sharp decline in the abortion care provided at the satellite clinic compared to the baseline. Till 2020- mid 2021, this satellite clinic was supported with a special grant to provide focused comprehensive abortion care. This support had given an opportunity to take medical method of abortion to the grassroot with the quality. The cost of these services is high, while FPA India is looking for other opportunities to revamp these services, reaching out with abortion care with same quantum is currently difficult within available budget. The loss of funds has impacted the couple year protection also, which is calculated basis the contraceptive services provided in the year.  The association with SHGs and LVGs has increased with 20% by inclusion of 73 new SHGs at both the branches.  As both branches entered into new intervention areas, a large number of clients availing services were screened for gender-based violence and provided with the counselling. As a result, with an additional 4,990 screening and counselling the number of GBV screening has almost doubled ( 88% increase) from 5,670 to 10,660.  The Teachers training on CSE were focused during the year which resulted in new associations with total 512 teachers ( original intervention areas of FPA India and new areas) who can be motivated further to conduct the SCE sessions in the schools. Disaster preparedness and MISP. The intervention areas selected from Sunderbans are susceptible to natural calamities like cyclones that can throw planned interventions out of gear, stretch health systems and exacerbate vulnerabilities. Therefore, under the project, disaster preparedness trainings are considered for the capacity building of the community members and stakeholders. The intervention for disaster preparedness under ASPIRE project is anticipated in phase 2. FPA India has received a special grant : SPRINT IV, for the capacity building of the staff and community members for disaster preparedness through MISP (Minimum Initial Service Package) training.  During the reporting period, 1 MISP training was held in May 2023 where youth volunteers, local NGOs, local link workers, participated. Although the training was planned for 3 full days, it was conducted only for one day due to gram panchayat elections. A fresh training will be conducted in phase II. Under SPRINT project, sexual and gender-based violence training was also conducted in Sudnerbans. The topics covered in the training program were: concept of SGBV, contributing factors of SGBV, consequences of SGBV, global and national SGBV prevalence, national legal frameworks, guiding principles of providing survivor centered care and communication skills. One media sensitization program was organized in May 2023 by involving all the local and national news channels to sensitize about disaster preparedness. NGOs like Sunderban KNS foundation, Indian Red Cross Society, Benkunthapur Shishu Seba Kendra, Leprosy mission,  Satjelia Vivekananda Milan Sangh, SNP+, Sonagachi Durbar, Manab Tirtha Sevashram, Human Rights Association participated and partnered for the MISP and disaster intervention.

Despite the doctors in the public facilities are more qualified and skilled than the private doctors, their skills are not being utilized optimally for marginalized people. Frequent absenteeism and unavailability of commodities are still leading to avoidance of public health facilities by people. As a result, people visit local private practitioners, ignoring the available public health units, and pay beyond their financial capacity. There is a persistent negative attitude towards public health facilities which has been observed and that will take time to change while the work with facility and authority will continue to strengthen the system.  Since there was a provision of budget through special grant under humanitarian work being conducted by FPA India, FPA India Kolkata branch had planned more trainings with gram panchayat workers, secretaries and Pradhans in areas of Sunderbans, however due to gram panchayat elections, it had to postpone over two months. Post election, new people joined in some of the GPs and rapport built with earlier people could not be utilized formally as a partnership with panchayat people.   8. Significant changes. If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular objective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key staffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   * Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be commented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report.  In December 2022, FPA India had conducted the national level training for Ministry of health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on insertion of subdermal single rod contraceptive implants (hormonal implants). Dr. S.K. Sikdar, Advisor, FP, MoHFW and his team attended the hands-on training in Delhi.  Through this experience, the Country Lead for Jhpiego requested for a training program for 5 doctors from Assam which was conducted in January 2023.  Similarly, MoHFW planned national level training of 30 Master Trainers (MTOT) on insertion of subdermal single rod contraceptive implants in 3 locations with the support of FPA India. These trainings were conducted in Delhi, Dharwad and Kolkata. The participants for MTOT were from Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. The trainees majorly from Medical Colleges, will have to further conduct the implants training for service providers in their respective districts as per the plan formulated by MoHFW. Dr. Rathnamala Desai, President, FPAI was the Core National Master Trainer for all the 3 training programmes.  Oak Progress Report.    13  In year 2023, FPA India took a decision of re-looking the methodologies of collecting data at different service delivery points. In the process, some of the branches including FPAI Kolkata branch had to drop out some partner associated clinics due to their inability to meet the criteria of quality-of-care services expected to be delivered/ reported.  Hence, these branches of FPA India are unable to renew the partnerships and that has impacted the overall volume of the data being reported for ASPIRE project.     9. Additional question(s): Please use this space to respond to any question(s) sent to you by the Oak programme team.  If none were received, please leave this section blank.  What is the infrastructure in the gardens - are their social workers or women volunteers, local communities in these gardens? Mothers club is an initiative in the tea Gardens for the community development through women empowerment with support from tea garden management. The chairperson of these clubs are the Garden Managers and the Hospital MO In-Charge or/ Labour Welfare officers or Assistant Managers plays the role of Member Secretary with 10 women members under each tea garden. FPA India works closely with these women volunteers in the tea gardens for the empowerment and enhancing sexual and reproductive health care in the tea garden community through the Kalchini branch. These women are part of the community; hence, they are also available outside tea gardens for SRH care.  How did you arrive at the catchment population of 250,000? As per the census 2011 population mentioned on Grammanchitra, the site of Ministry of Panchayati Raj, govt. of India which was referred for mapping, the population of Kalchini is 3,85,108 out of which most of the areas FPA India is already working through intervention. The population of Madarihat shows 1,73,707 in 2022 census. The total population comes to 5,58,815.  The Census site shows some indicator based expected increase in the population which considered following MoHFW published Population projection report, where, the population growth of west Bengal is  indicating 8%. Considering that, the estimated population of Madarihat comes close to 1,90,000 . the remaining population estimation was taken for Kalchinis new tea gardens and few villages near Jaigaon are included. Thus, the estimation of 2,50,000 was considered for expansion.  Are there any of the clinical activities carried out in the gardens? Apart from awareness and sensitization meetings, FPA India organizes special service sessions in the tea garden for general health care and SRH care. The screening of cervical cancer is also done in the selected tea gardens for women.  Does this refer to the doctors or others as well? (The findings indicated the need of clinical training to the current service providers for sexual and reproductive health.)       This was with reference to the doctors as clinical service providers.  What is the contribution of the health department to the Palki Ambulance? FPA India volunteers have been active in Buxa doors to support for immunization, helping women to access hospitals for an institutional delivery. Kalchini branch had proposed the idea of Palki Ambulance to the district Administrator to ensure the safe and relatively easy transport of pregnant women and other patients which was then proposed by him to health department for the  Oak Progress Report.    14 approval and implementation. The health department sanctioned the project implementation and also planned to make more palkis which would be lighter in weight.   Are there any training activities that target the doctors and nurses at the tea garden hospitals? (A total of 182 ASHAs and 56 ANMS have been sensitized by Kalchini branch for SRH care.) In the past, FPA India had covered about 12 tea gardens for the training of clinical staff with support of special grant focusing on SRH care. However, in the last one and half years there are no trainings conducted for the tea garden clinical staff such as doctors and nurses.  Have you shared any recommendations from the FGDs findings with the department which may have implications for the PIPs? The recommendations were not shared in the meetings conducted so far. The data sharing in the meetings was pertaining to the special project supported in Buxa Doors for SRH activities.  However, it will be done in subsequent meetings where revisions in the PIP budget may be considered. It will be done along with seeking approvals for the training of the doctors available in the government facilities in Kalchini and Madarihat.  Can you share the age groups, gender and social profiles of the trainees? The women referred for the livelihood skills trainings were mostly between the age groups of 30-35. Two amongst them were 24 years old. While all 8 were married at one point, the younger two were deserted by their partners. All except one were survivors of domestic violence either by their intimate partners or family members. Four of them were from tribal community and three reported to be originally Nepali.  Since Gosaba is a common area for both, there is potential for providing comprehensive health awareness and referral services. Definitely there is a potential to have for providing comprehensive health together. Under the partnership with Liver foundation, FPA India will train all three categories of volunteers of liver foundation in batches on sexual reproductive health, gender-based violence and minimum initial service package for humanitarian situations. On receiving trainings, volunteers who are essentially from Gosaba block, can use the knowledge in the community along with their dedicated work and also refer the clients when there is any health camp, they can also support in mobilization when the camps are being conducted.  Do you have sex-disaggregated data for the children and young people who attended these sessions? The table below can explain gender disaggregated data for children and young people for the sessions attended in school and out of school (sessions in the community). Please note that the table shared in the narrative report has data up to June 2023. The table shared below , has data up to July 2023 as received by the branches. Also, the data in the reporting system comes for entire intervention areas and not segregated for project specific.   Total children and young people attended CSE sessions. 37,728 Total male children and young people attended CSE sessions 14,349 (38.03%)   Total female children and young people attended CSE sessions 23,340 (61.86%)   Total other children and young people attended CSE sessions 39 (0.10%)    Oak Progress Report.    15     Total children and young people attended CSE sessions in schools. 25,153 (66.67% of the total) Total male children and young people attended CSE sessions in schools. 9,342 (37.14%) Total female children and young people attended CSE sessions in schools. 15,811 (62.86%)       Total children and young people attended CSE sessions in the community (out of school). 12,575 (33.33% of the total)   Total male children and young people attended CSE sessions in the community (out of school). 5,007 (39.82%)   Total female children and young people attended CSE sessions in the community (out of school). 7,529 (59.87%)   Total other children and young people attended CSE sessions in the community (out of school). 39 (0.31%)      Can you elaborate on some of the partnerships? (FPA India Kalchini branchs presence in Madarihat with comprehensive abortion care services is resulting in healthy partnerships with other stakeholders well.) The partnerships with grassroot workers like ASHAs , AWWs which were developed earlier helped the team to reach out to the community with health camps, and also to get referrals. While partnership with PRI members doesnt help in actually organizing the services, they were made aware of the work being done in SRH field and the support of ASHAs , ANMs. Their support and presence in the outreach activities positively influences community people to access the services provided in the outreach and also to access the Satellite clinic services. In terms of comprehensive sexuality education sessions, the classes taken earlier in the schools had helped to build relationships with schoolteachers. Hence organizing ToTs resulting in teachers conducting the sessions  was possible within one years time.   How does the CSE module integrate aspects related to gender and diversity? FPA India has a comprehensive sexuality education module, designed to equip adolescents with knowledge, skills, attitudes and values related to sexuality and relationships. The aim of this CSE module is to encourage young adolescents to enjoy the growing up phase safely, responsibly and healthily. As one of the components, Gender and Diversity is introduced in the module. The sessions based on Gender and Diversity cover difference between gender and sex; exploring gender roles and attributes; understanding perceptions of masculinity and femininity within the family and across the life cycle; societys changing norms and values; manifestations and consequences of gender bias, myths; and inequality, recognizing and understanding the range of diversity in our lives (e.g., faith, culture, ethnicity, socio-economic status, ability/disability, HIV status and sexual orientation); recognizing discrimination, its damaging effects and being able to deal with it; developing a belief in equality etc.  Have you spoken to IPAS in this regard as they have a strong presence in the state departments?  Oak Progress Report.    16 There is an update on this which is of August 2023. At present, total 265 ASHAs and 2 ANMS have undergone the training in Sunderbans on SRH. The meetings were conducted by FPA India Kolkata BM in this regard with block medical officer of health, Basanti Rural Hospital and with his directive and approval the training was conducted on 24th August in Basanti. FPA India has a partnership with IPAS independently for SRH work as well and wherever applicable, the partnership will be explored for work in Sunderbans.  Please send me the baseline reports as it was meant to provide the benchmarks to assess the annual progress. I suggest that you use them to reflect the % changes as currently the figures are mentioned in absolute terms.  Although the text  under the accomplishments is well-written, it will be great if you can refer to the approved outcomes in the future. Also, wherever applicable please provide sex- and social group- disaggregated data. I am sharing the baseline report separately as an attachment as it is a bit heavy in size. Also, henceforth we will project the changes/ progress in the indicators as per the % change and also basis the approved outcomes.  what is the strategy for engaging with the tea garden management for ensuring services to the workers and their families ? and the plan to engage with state departments to inform programmes/policies based on the refined findings from  the FGDs and the direct interventions? Regarding the strategies to engage the tea garden management for ensuring services to the workers and their families, currently FPA India is providing the general health and SRH care services in the Tea gardens along with awareness / sensitization meetings with managements  permission. The regular contact with other club members like youth club, community clubs in the villages reflect in the referral services to the RHFPC to ensure the services are accessible and affordable to the community women. FPA India has worked in the past with some of the tea gardens (about 12 gardens from Kalchini) and trained the clinical staff, however, considering the turnover of clinical staff, referrals are made to the hospital for general care and for SRH care mostly people prefer to come to FPA India.    Also, as a next step, in December 2023, while PIP revisions may happen in review meeting, FPA India Kalchini branch has planned to send a proposal for special projects where the FDG finding will also be presented. There will be an attempt to involve youth members or women volunteers from the community during the meetings.  Is there a reason for not mentioning this source (Sprint IV) in the table 5 of the finance report? Contribution of Sprint IV has been included under IPPF, as the grant is coming from IPPF, also , inserting additional row was not working in the protected file.     With respect to the finance report, please check the year 1 budget figures (both Total and Oak)  from the grant letter as they do not match. Do let us know if you are expecting any revisions in the year 2 budget. As per instruction given in Oak Budget to Actuals Report (please refer point no.4.) , the Annual budget must match exactly what was approved In the grant letter unless a Budget Revision Form was approved, in which case the revised amount should be listed. Therefore, annual budget for reporting period showed  as per Budget Revision i.e. (Total project) INR 183,04,576 & (OAK) INR 92,62,337. Basis the mail from Oak Foundation indicating the in principal approval on six field workers for Sunerbans for the project period, some revisions are made in the budget along with adjusting the original budget. The revisions made will be shared by the Finance and Accounts team for Year 2 (July 2023 to June 2024). The variance in % contribution is mainly due to additional budget for field workers.

Objective 1 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Background: Under this project, the activities started with learning and understanding the process and  using the different tools like social mapping, listing, scoring and ranking, power analysis, daily routine activities, mobility map, migration chart, SWOC (strength weakness opportunity and challenges) analysis of the vulnerable families under participatory vulnerability and capacity assessment, base line study were done. There were vulnerabilities found among the marginal farmers families, women particularly of women headed families, agri-labourer, landless labourer and migrant labourer, adolescents both boys and girls of the resource poor families particularly, aged and physically challenged persons, who are in very difficult situation in socio-economic, environment and cultural point of view. On the basis of the findings of vulnerabilities came out, the micro plan chalked out. Accordingly the process of empowering of the community groups started with them after prioritization of the problems of the reference groups of adolescents, women, marginal farmers and labourers, aged and physically challenged persons. The three reference villages are 1) Ram Nagar Abad, 2) Gurudaspur, 3) Paschim Sridhar Pur of Digambarpur Gram Panchayat of Pathar Pratima block of Sundarban, West Bengal, India. The activities   were as follows: Adolescents both boys and girls groups formed:        Total groups of adolescents formed : 14 (one boys and one girls group, other 12 are mixed groups) Total members of those 14 groups are 312 (boys-70, girls-242) Becoming proactive to take action thinking in a safe space of knowledge building, understanding and sharing and trust building: Adolescents are beginning to think and sharing their problems with peers, where confidentiality is also maintained, where there is free and open space for sharing and understanding with game mode of facilitation, question and answer session, storytelling, interacting session etc. They have started to think on doing some work and taking shared responsibility for any action of plantation and nurturing, plastic collection and rejection campaigning, wall writing and wall painting for community awareness, other social actions. Collective leadership is promoted among them. Interest grown among the adolescent groups getting opportunities of fun and learning together. Bonding and friendship made among the adolescents with identity mapping, ground rules setting, goal setting etc. Behavior changes among boys, they realized that girls should be regarded equally with boys where eve- teasing and other negative thinking and behavior towards girls should be changed and stopped and treated equally. Negative mannerism that is demeaned to girls customarily by boys is being reduced as the girls shared.  Oak Progress Report.    3 Parents are being cooperative and supportive towards engagement of their children. Parents are spending time with children, talking to them, listening to their views. Building strong relationship and understanding with the parents of adolescents on their engagement in groups/collectives and discussion on building knowledge, and change of attitude and behavior in daily life. Planning to collectively talk to panchayat for regular supply of sanitary pad for the adolescent girls. Also to go in to dialogue with school authority for hygiene to be maintained at school toilet for girls particularly. Knowledge building of the adolescent groups on gender, wants and need, basic human rights, child rights, know yourself, understanding on societal context, adolescent health and hygiene, issues of menstruation, thinking and understanding of what is right and wrong concepts and practices during menstruation cycle, physical and mental or emotional changes of adolescent ages, which is natural and normal as realized. The other changes what are seen among the groups of adolescents as follows: i. The adolescents both boys and girls have mutually accepted the physically challenged, minority group(muslims), school drop out and all the castes altogether in their groups, bonding and friendship made with each other. ii. They are attending meeting regularly as scheduled. Their parents are also becoming cooperative. iii. Case of sexual abuse is shared with field worker. Free and open space created where they are sharing their opinion, problems and thinking to mitigate the same. iv. They have built trust on the facilitator as their friend and guide. They are gradually able to overcome their uneasy complexity to express views and opinion on issues and matters, what they cannot share with parents and members of their families. Few cases of child abuse, school dropout, and early marriage have come out.  Collective action taken so far by the adolescent groups- in progress: i. Celebration on Children Day: ii. Collective action by the adolescent collectives on awareness on pandemic: iii. Peer to peer support to reduce school dropout and child labour: iv. Advocacy for VLCPC formation : v. Celebration of world environment day, wall painting, plantation by the adolescent group: vi. Plastic rejection propagation drive by the adolescent groups and plantation: They have also planned to continue the process initiated by them to collect plastics on regular basis at their home and surroundings, which will be collected by the panchayat sending van to their locality. vii. Celebration of independence day by the adolescents group: viii. Engagement of adolescent groups with local water user committee: As per their aspiration it should be functioning well for the benefit of the water user families and the community at large. The adolescent group also said that they would also visit and meet another water user committee where the problems if any, can be solved in this way. ix. They have begun to have sanitary napkin from the health personnel where some are hesitate to talk. Activities with Physically challenged adolescents: 10 adolescents of 10-16 years of age group identified and households visited. Out of ten, the three have no registration card i.e. certificate of disability. The respective families are trying to contact with subdivisional hospital of Kakdwip to have their doctors certificate at first and then to apply for handicapped certificates.  Oak Progress Report.    4 The others seven have card and accessed the social security scheme of Manobik pension.   Marginal farmers group formed:  Total farmers group formed : 7  Total members involved with the farmers group: 127 (M-  14, F- 113), Farmers are beginning to learn and expose skill and knowledge, understanding, sharing and practices of agro-eco system management:  Mostly women farmers are engaged in the process of development and coming forward with their leadership. The group members and encouraged to take part in baseline to share their present status of the agri-plot, cost and production etc.  Becoming trained and skilled on promotion of organic method with preparation of organic manure and pest control technique and its applications, nutrition gardening, vegetable seed of indigenous variety procurement and preservation they are in practice of procurement of seeds like vegetables, pulses, paddy etc. of indigenous variety and preservation process, they have planned to procure indigenous vegetable seeds and its preservation.  Doing organic farming practices agro-eco farming as practicing of preparation of compost, taral sar, amrit pani and uses, practices and promotion of nutrition garden, local seed variety of vegetables procurement and preservation  particularly in every marginal farmer family.  Progress of collective action by the farmers group:  Soil test and soil health card distribution from KVK, Nimpith :  Advocacy with panchayat for convergence on the compost pit making and land shaping for integrated farming for the marginal farmers:  Technical training and agri-inputs from the office of the Assistant Director of Agriculture (ADA):  Nutrition Gardening by the farmers:  Farmers are following indigeneous seed procurement and preservation process:  Plan for making nursery by the farmers group: Future Plan of the Farmers:  They will keep regular contact with the office of ADA and Krishi Vijnan Kendra (KVK) for agricultural training and inputs are in need.  They will keep regular contact with the office of BLDO and fishery department for agri-allied sectors- poultry, goatery, dairy, piggery, fish rearing etc.  training and inputs are in need. Farmers groups have identified issues  such as identification and utilization of local resources- renovation of drainage in a village, mobilization of resources from panchayat like support for construction of compost pit, land shaping accessing the entitlements of schemes talking to them with periodical follow up.    7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  Oak Progress Report.    5  Absenteeism of some group members is a major challenge.  Fruitful discussion cannot be happened with active participation from all as the absentees are unable to link thoughts with new content.  Particularly boys of 16+ are less interested to join the group, is a great challenge to bring them into the process.  School time and sometimes sudden and frequent changes of tuition time of the adolescent boys and girls did not match with the time of meeting.  Basically farmers are reluctant to adopt new scientific method of farming due to their negligence of hard toil. Sometimes they present lame excuse to avoid this cultivation process. Instead women are becoming interested and given focus.  Farmers mostly expect some material supports of direct gain. Few farmers think, it would be of help in farming.  Some parents are having less caring and importance over their siblings, which cause irregularities in attending adolescent meeting.  It is difficult to have much number of male farmers in time of training or discussion due to their busy schedule of livelihood activities and having lack of interest to join.   Heavy rainfall, tuition, occasion and festival cause to postpone the session of adolescent collectives.  Men and women are also busy in household chores, very less time in hand to attend meeting as they shared.  Some are also hesitating to talk. Learnings and adjustments:  Rapport building with the community is to be made very intensively.  Ensure community participation in any session growing interest among the participants through creating an open and learning environment, a special day for them.  More information and more support which is beneficial for community are to be provided, where they are also facilitated to thinking any new for their own.  Home visit with interaction on regular basis with the parents/farmers for trust building and clearing of any doubt can be a good strategy.  Community leadership and feeling of ownership by the community would be effective in executing any plan.  Regular monitoring and handholding support to the reference people are to be provided.  Date, time and venue of meeting are fixed by the community as convenient for them.    7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective To build strong and meaningful network with the hub partners and the other resource agencies and stakeholders strengthening its process of facilitation the process of development.    Oak Progress Report.    6  7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Skill building as essential, thematic issues of rights and gender, for staff capacity building of the implementing organization based upon need assessment of the staff, resource agencies are imparting training from time to time. Putting the things of learning from training and workshops into practice in the field by the implementing organizations as developing their plan of implementation. There has been a process of learning continued to build network among the resource organizations, implementing and other organizations through virtual and physical workshops, verbal communication over phone. The guidance and strategic advice over the process of implementation of this project as and when needed are helping the implementing organizations as meaningful and effective. The implementing organizations are also building a meaningful relationship when they share their knowledge and experience on different issues and challenges, what steps they take for its resolution. All are supportive and cooperative each other, where there are scopes of exposure for the community groups to visit any model activity. Additionally we are having support from the resource organizations like NIITI, Headways on theory of changes and making child safe guarding policy respectively. What we are doing to strengthening partnership:  We proactively want support of skill enhancement of staff and capacitation on issues based topics.  Sharing the experiences and challenges in steering group meeting, training and workshops.    7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. During pandemic the virtual training and capacity building for the staff of this project were organized only. As a result capacity building of staff was in delay and not effectively done. The implementation of the project hampered in that time. Next after normalization of situation of pandemic slowly the staff capacity building physical workshops were conducted which were more useful then virtual. It was more effective with skill and knowledge enhancement of the staff has made them confident enough to conduct fruitful meeting with the community.    7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective  Oak Progress Report.    7 Reduce gender inequality and domestic violence, child dropout, child labour and child marriage in this area.    7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  1. Women group formed: Total group formed :6 Total women involved : 119   Women are also beginning to start or progress understanding and sharing on gender and practices individually, in family and in public places: i. Women leaders are seen proactive to ground rule setting, goal setting, ii. Building perspective on gender and behaviour change, positive parenting etc., they have started thinking on gender issues identifying the areas of discriminations. iii. Also they are  identifying the problems like unequal division of labour, power walking and analysis and thinking on how they will get power, economic empowerment accessing the entitlements of schemes and programmes of social security schemes by the women collectives. Collective effort taken so far by the women groups- in progress: Peer to peer support among the women group members : The PEER mothers are identifying the others who are habituated to practice the preference of boys to girls at household level and trying to motivate with peer pressure not to do such practice in future. They are also supporting others to reduce/stop this thing. A plan for their vocational skill development by the women group: The women groups have made a plan for having vocational skill building for alternative sources of income.

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Swaniti Initiative conducted a baseline study to determine the accessibility of Government Social Protection schemes by tea garden workers, across gardens in four districts of West Bengal i.e Darjeeling, Alipurduar, Kochbihar, and Jalpaiguri.  The study included a sample of 7488 respondents from these four districts of West Bengal. The study was conducted using three methods: Household surveys, semi-structured interviews, and focused group discussions. The data was collected by Swaniti team and volunteers through digital intervention of Surveymana survey management tool.    Using this report as a backbone, Swaniti designed interventions across all the 4 districts mentioned above.        7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles.

Based on our findings some of which are: complete lack of grievance redressal mechanisms as reported by 100% of the respondents and 1 out of every 4 respondents had incorrect information printed on their Aadhaar Card, the following challenges were faced:  Challenges:  The study faced challenges during data collection, with respondents initially reluctant to share information. However, our swaniti team  and volunteers were able to explain the purpose of the study and its potential benefits to the tea workers.   Oak Progress Report.    3  Access to information was another challenge, with most respondents needing to be made aware of important social protection schemes. The surveyors had to explain these schemes and how the tea workers could benefit from them. Key Learning Overall, the study highlights the need for greater awareness and accessibility of  Government Social Protection schemes for tea garden workers in West Bengal. There is a need for robust mechanisms to be placed to ensure that all the tea garden workers receive benefits from these schemes.        7.2.a.

Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Swaniti initiative collaborated with the Department of Post, Government of  West Bengal, and organized the Aadhaar enrollment and Correction camp in Balasun, Dhooteria, Lingia, and Gopalpur Tea Gardens. The camps aimed to reach out to as many people as possible and efficiently conduct the enrollment and correction processes. These camps successfully reached out a total of 1,309 beneficiaries, further to which Swaniti will work on linking these beneficiaries to different government schemes.   Example: A voice from the community -   Hello my name is Sujata Manger and this is my son Ankit Manger he was unable to obtain an Aadhaar card, but thanks to this camp, he was able to get it without difficulty. He is not alone, there are a number of other people in the tea garden who also do not have an Aadhaar card. I am now optimistic that my son will be able to access different government schemes after getting his Aadhaar card - Sujata Manager - Dhajea TG, Darjeeling   Outcomes of the Aadhar Correction Camps:  Oak Progress Report.    4 1. The camps were able to enroll and correct the Aadhaar details of a total of 1,309 beneficiaries. These beneficiaries were able to obtain their Aadhaar cards without any difficulty and ensure their details were updated and accurate. 2. Many tea garden workers in the vicinity, including Tumsun TE, Munda, Miling, Kalej Valley TG, and Samirkpani TE, were able to get their Aadhaar cards corrected conveniently as a result of the camps. This helped them avoid the inconvenience and expense of traveling long distances to access Aadhaar services. 3. The teams working at the camps conducted awareness sessions to educate people about the importance of Aadhaar and its benefits. This helped people understand the significance of the Aadhaar card and its role in accessing various government schemes and services. 4. The successful acquisition of Aadhaar cards by the beneficiaries will enable them to access various government schemes and services with ease. This will help them avail themselves of important benefits and support provided by the government. 5. The Aadhaar card helps the government to maintain accurate and updated data on tea garden workers, which can be used for planning and policy formulation. Overall, Swaniti's efforts to link tea garden workers with different government schemes through the correction of their Aadhaar cards will help ensure that tea garden workers have access to the available social protection schemes, thereby building a more inclusive and equitable society in West Bengal.        7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Challenges: Over the course of one year, a number of attempts were made through various channels in order to establish convergence and acquire the necessary permissions for conducting Aadhaar camps. These efforts were made in the face of significant opposition from various stakeholders (like private associations, local leaders, etc.) who stood to benefit from maintaining the existing status quo, rather than facilitating social and financial inclusion for the dependents of tea gardens. The opposition that the team encountered was multifaceted and ranged from vitriolic political interference sometime creating a major bottleneck in service delivery. Despite these challenges, the team was able to organize Aadhaar Enrollment/ correction camps that enabled more than 1300 dependents to become eligible for a range of social welfare schemes.  Learnings: As a learning strategy, Swaniti plans to onboard the district administrations of all four districts when organizing the Aadhaar camps and other interventions for a smooth flow of work processes. Swaniti also plans to onboard and work with the  forms of government and private ( Team associations) stakeholders to reach the maximum number of garden workers through the intervention plan in place.

Swaniti is working across a  range of stakeholders ranging from the communities into the district and state administration at large. We are in the process of creating pockets of evidence that can work as proof of concepts for scale up and adoption by the key decision makers. To achieve this we have designed the following strategy : Needs assessment: A thorough needs assessment was conducted to identify the specific challenges faced by tea garden workers in accessing social protection schemes. That includes issues related to documentation, access to information, and barriers related to caste or gender. Stakeholder mapping and engagement: Tea garden workers themselves, as well as community leaders, civil society organizations, and other Government stakeholders, were mapped to be engaged in the policy development process, ensuring that the needs and perspectives of the aforementioned groups are considered. Capacity building: The policy framework includes provisions for building the capacity of tea garden workers to access and utilize social protection schemes. This includes training on documentation and application procedures, as well as outreach and awareness raising efforts to ensure that workers are aware of their rights and entitlements. Interdepartmental coordination: Coordination between different government departments and agencies being crucial for ensuring the effective implementation of social protection schemes, the policy framework works to ensure interdepartmental coordination and collaboration. Monitoring and evaluation: Regular monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the policy framework involving regular feedback from tea garden workers and other stakeholders, as well as quantitative data on enrollment and utilization of social protection schemes. Grassroots implementation: The implementation of the policy framework ensures that tea garden workers are aware of the available schemes and their accessibility.

Objective 1 Objective To promote understanding and responsibility of employers, monitoring & regulatory bodies for creation of safe workplaces that are free of sexual harassment for institutionally employed women especially from resource poor background.    7.1.b. Objective 1 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Sanhita, in its effort to reach out to the most marginalised women workers within the organised sector, chose to engage with the women of the two most important industries in the states economy, viz, Jute & Tea. The Jute Mills in the state employs around 25000 women workers and the number is constantly increasing over the past two years. Historically, tea plantations have always been a traditional employer of large number of women. Almost 61% of the 3.2 lakh workers employed in the tea plantations of West Bengal are women. However, information on the safety of women workers (ie. sexual harassment as an aspect of working condition and welfare) is lacking in both the industries. In order to create a body of evidence which would help in advocacy for safe workspaces, Sanhita conducted Situation Analysis in both the industries to understand the safety of women workers (in the context of sexual harassment at workplace). The studies investigated the perceptions and prevalence of sexual harassment, the accountability of key stakeholders towards promoting safe workplace for women and the implementation of 2013 Act. These reports will serve as an important document on the safety of women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations. The Situation Analysis in Jute Industry was conducted in 2019 among women workers of 6 Jute Mills and leadership of 7 Jute Federations and 6 Jute Unions in Hooghly and North 24 Parganas districts. The Situation Analysis in Tea Plantations was conducted in 2022 and covered government and non-government stakeholders like the district administration, the Labour Department of GoWB, the tea garden management, trade unions, tea associations; besides the women workers themselves from 24 tea gardens in two (Dooars and Terai) of the three tea growing regions. Some of the key findings common to both industries that have emerged from the two independent studies are:  Lack of awareness regarding safe workplaces (including sexual harassment of women at workplace (SHW), the POSH Act, 2013 and its provisions) of almost all respondents in the jute mills & the tea gardens.  Compliance with the Act is marginal.  The issue of safe workplaces, in the context of sexual harassment, has not even been considered to be an integral component of working conditions or labour rights of women workers. The very large numbers of women employed in the two industries studied are vulnerable due to their position at the bottom of the hierarchy, casualisation of employment, overall isolated and dependent work conditions which are further compounded by poverty, low wages, migration status, domestic violence and low literacy levels. The government departments like the district administration (District Officer) who is responsible for overall implementation of 2013 Act in the respective districts or the labour department who is responsible for overall welfare and rights of workers have not adopted any appropriate measures towards ensuring safe workplaces for marginal women workers.  Oak Progress Report.    3 Sanhita has utilised the Situation Analysis findings as a tool for advocacy and intervention with multiple stakeholders. The outreach to women workers has been channelled through intense and consistent engagement with the Trade Unions who are directly working with them. Parallelly Sanhita conducted evidence-based advocacy with the employers, employers association, Labour Department and District Administration for creating safe workplaces for its women workers through implementation and monitoring of the 2013 Act. Overall Outcomes in both Industries  Knowledge Creation on status of safe workplaces for marginalised women workers: The 2 Situation Analysis studies have created thus far unavailable information and evidence on the safety of women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations in West Bengal.  Voices of Women Workers were documented and shared with relevant stakeholders: The hitherto unheard voices of the underrepresented women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations were brought to light by Sanhita through Situation Analysis study and the intervention programmes. The voices served as evidence for Sanhitas dialogue and advocacy with the key stakeholders like the monitoring bodies, the employers and the trade unions.    The plight of the women workers in Jute Mills and Tea Plantations get highlighted in print Media articles: During the course of dissemination of the Situation Analysis findings, Sanhita organised 2 centralised meetings with the Jute Mill Unions and Tea Plantation Unions respectively. These events and the study findings got very well covered in the media articles. Following this different groups working with marginal/unorganised workers have reached out to Sanhita seeking further information. The Situation Analysis report soft and hard copies have been widely disseminated among these different groups and organisations. Major Outcomes in Jute Industry  The Employers got evidence-based knowledge of the SHW issue and the implementation status of the 2013 Act: The findings of the Situation Analysis were shared at all levels, the Labour Department, GoWB, Employers Association and Trade Union Leaders. In case of the Jute Industry, taking this information to Indian Jute Mill Association (IJMA) was a critical need as IJMA is an apex organisation representing the management of the jute mills in India.  In a scenario where reaching out to IJMA was proving to be a challenge, the Labour Departments timely intervention helped immensely. The Labour department, which was already well acquainted with Sanhitas work, took cognizance of its efforts and referred Sanhita to the Indian Jute Mill Association (IJMA). A series of dialogue and interactions with the Addl. Labour Commissioner and IJMA Chairman resulted in the initial capacity building of member jute mills of IJMA.  Sanhita collaborated with IJMA for a day-long orientation for Senior profile officers representing Human Resource, Personnel & Administration Departments and the Labour Officers of the Jute Mills. Further capacity building for HR/ Labour Officers of the member jute mills of IJMA shall be conducted in collaboration with IJMA in 2023-24.  Recommendations for implementation of the POSH Act were acknowledged by the Employers and Trade Unions:   IJMA agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in this initiative. It has a total number of 35-member jute mills, out of which 33 owned by 29 companies are located in West Bengal. Sanhita received requests from member jute mills for further capacity building of the HR of the Jute Mills to develop systems of prevention and redress of SHW. Based on the requests Sanhita plans to collaborate with IJMA for conducting the Orientation Programs in 2023-24.   The Trade Unions acknowledged their lack of awareness regarding the issue & the 2013 Act and also recognized the need to include sexual harassment free safe workplaces on their  Oak Progress Report.    4 agenda and focus on rights education for women workers. This becomes more relevant in the context of gradually increasing number of women workers in the jute mills, and their proposed engagement in the night shift. Senior leaders of the Trade Unions agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in conducting a series of Orientation Programmes on the rights of women workers in the jute mills as laid down in the 2013 Act. Till March 2023, Sanhita had conducted 5 such orientation programs covering 8 jutes mills in collaboration with 2 trade unions.  Implementation of 2013 Act becomes part of the agenda of the Trade Unions: Finally, as a result of Sanhitas continued dialogue and interactions with the trade union leaders  central & mill based, over the past four years, the issue of SHW has been included in the Charter of Demands of the Jute Mill Workers dated 28th January 2022. Point No 8 (b) of the Charter of Demands addressed to the Labour Department and the jute mill owners says: Separate rest rooms, wash rooms, creche should be provided. Laws relating working women \"The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013'' must be strictly adhered to and Internal Complaint Committee should be formed as per law\"   Major Outcomes in Tea Plantations:  Representative of Labour Department has expressed willingness to facilitate engagement with Tea Associations and Management: Through continued dialogue and interaction over the past two years with the Tea Advisor to the Labour Minister, GoWB, has acknowledged Sanhitas work and referred Sanhita to tea associations during the Situation Analysis study.  The findings of the study were shared with him and he has agreed to extend support to Sanhita and advised Sanhita to dialogue with the Labour Secretary and seek support during orientation for the tea associations and management.   Intervention Plan in place for taking forward the initiatives: Based on the Situation Analysis findings and recommendations received on the Situation Analysis report from different stakeholders, Sanhita has developed an Intervention Plan to reach out to The Employers  tea garden owners and management, The Tea Associations, The District Administration, the Labour Department, The Trade Unions and Women Workers with the information about SHW Issue, provisions of the Act, rights covered in the Act, complaint & redress mechanism.            Gaps & recommendations for implementation are acknowledged by the Trade Unions:  The findings of the Situation Analysis study were shared with 37 senior profile Trade Union leaders, both central and garden level. It has been a challenge to             bring different unions together and create a synergy on the issue and needs of the women workers. With persistent efforts, the unions have agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in organising orientation programmes for women workers and garden level             union leaders on the issue of SHW and the Act at zonal level of Terai and Dooars region.    7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  There is risk on the part of the women workers to raise the issue either in small group interactions or openly in any meeting as the majority of the women are casual workers and there is fear of losing work if they talk about their experiences or complain against their superiors.  Oak Progress Report.    5  Trade Unions had neither prioritised the issue of safe workplaces in the context of SHW nor had any clear concept about the issue and the Act.  Trade Unions in West Bengal are still dominated by male leadership. Raising the issue of SHW in this patriarchal bastion posed a serious challenge. Sanhita developed a strategic partnership with a civil society organisation, Nagarik Mancha who has a long history of working on labour rights issues. The partnership helped reaching out to the Trade Unions and creating a positive influence among the Trade Union leadership in recognising the work of Sanhita and the importance of the issue of SHW.  Major roadblock was faced in reaching out to the jute mills employers. Sanhitas long association of working with the Labour Department helped reaching out to the jute mill employers through IJMA.  The tea gardens in the state are undergoing a massive state of turmoil. The workers are demanding for land patta and implementation of Minimum Wages Act in place of Plantation Labour Act, which means a paradigm shift in the wage structure in the tea gardens.  Moreover, the political situation in the Hilly Regions is also volatile. Reaching out to the tea plantations workers, grassroots trade unions and the tea garden management and raising the issue of SHW in the hilly region posed a major challenge amidst such a situation.           Labour department has not included the issue of SHW and its prevention on their agenda and they do not consider themselves the enforcing authority for the 2013 Act.    7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective To create access of women workers to information regarding SHW Issue & the SHWW Act through various institutions and support redress of complaints    7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Sanhita has taken multiple routes to ensure that marginal women workers gain access to the information on SHW issue, the 2013 Act and their rights to a safe workplace. One of this has been integral to the intervention process both during the course of conducting the Situation Analysis as well through sharing the findings of the report with the women workers. The other approach has been through dissemination of stakeholder specific IEC materials which provided information both on the issue and the Act.  Women Workers in the Jute Mills received information on the issue of SHW and the 2013 Act  Through a series of orientation sessions, it has been possible to directly reach out to 225 workers from around 8 Jute Mills in the Hooghly and North 24 Parganas districts. 86% of the workers i.e 194 were women. Strategically, some interested and active male workers were also included in these orientation programmes.  The programmes were organised in the Muhallas of the jute mills in Gate Meeting style.  Oak Progress Report.    6  The women workers who participated initially with trepidation have over a period of time gained the confidence to speak out about their own experiences in the workplace and instances of sexual harassment faced.  There has been a gradual swell of womens active participation in the meetings as well as within the unions.  Trade Unions collaborated with Sanhita in this initiative. They took an active role in selecting the meeting venue in the vicinity of the jute mills, ensuring participation of the women workers from the adjacent jute mills and arranging logistics for the programmes.  The meetings served as a platform for raising the awareness of the women workers on the issue, the Act and their rights as workers. This understanding of their rights is what is motivating the women to break their silence and speak out. Reaching out to Women Workers in the Tea Gardens A similar process is underway with select Tea Gardens in North Bengal wherein the findings of the Situation Analysis will be shared with the women workers in the plantations. This initiative has already been included in the Intervention Plan for 2023-2024.  Stakeholder specific IEC Material Primer on the POSH Act, 2013  A comprehensive document in English which presents the provisions and nuances of the POSH Act, 2013 in a lucid and easy to understand format. This has been extensively shared with Employers, Employers Associations, Internal Committees (ICs), NGOs & Human Rights Activists, Monitoring Bodies and the Trade Unions. The Primer is being disseminated in both soft and hard copies.  Booklet in Bangla (Karmakhetre Jouno Henosthar Mokabilay Narikarmee)  In a scenario where there was not a single material available on SHW issue and the Act in Bangla language which could be read and understood by women workers Sanhita developed and printed this booklet. It not only explains the issue and the Act in simple language but also gives practical information on what women can do during a crisis situation. The booklet has been disseminated to marginal Women Workers and Trade Unions among others. There has been a demand from the unions in North Bengal & the Jute Mills for the booklet to be provided in Hindi and the translation has already been completed and printing in progress. Leaflet in 3 languages (Say No to SHW)  Printed in English, Bangla and Hindi the leaflets provide a snapshot view of the Act viz a viz employers responsibility and womens workplace rights. This easy to comprehend content has been extensively circulated among women workers and other stakeholders. These leaflets are also available in white board animation format. Situation Analysis Reports  The Situation Analysis not only captures the voices of women workers in Jute Mills and Tea Plantations, but its findings are also being taken back to the women workers so that they gain an understanding regarding the status of safety at their own workplaces. Sanhitas footprint at the Kolkata Book Fair 2023  Sanhitas strategic partner Nagarik Manchas stall at the Kolkata Book Fair was dedicated to the issue of Marginal Women Workforce. The stall had a display of all of Sanhitas IEC materials which were widely disseminated. The issue of SHW in the context of marginal women workers got highlighted for the first time ever at a prestigious event such as the Book Fair. Crisis Intervention Services To support redress of complaints, Sanhita adopted multi-pronged strategies  support to aggrieved women, support to SHW Committees in dealing with complaints, identification of procedural and knowledge gaps in handling of SHW complaints, and understanding of barriers in effective case redress for strengthening the justice delivery mechanism in the capacity of external member, support group or advisor.  Oak Progress Report.    7   In the capacity of External Member Presently Sanhita is representing at about 14 Complaints Committees across Education Institutions, Medical Colleges & Hospitals, Central & State Government offices which employ a large number of women workers and/or working as Sanhitas strategic partners. These SHW Committees receive technical support at regular interval from Sanhita to deal with the complaints effectively. In the past one year (April, 2022  March, 2023) Sanhita has dealt with 5 complaints in the capacity of External Member in the Internal Committees (ICs) and in two cases Sanhita has played the support role. 1 case has been reported in a Security Force of Central Government, 2 cases were from a Central Government organisation and 2 cases were from 2 different Medical Colleges & Hospitals.  As a result of Sanhitas presence, facilitation and participation, the following outcomes were achieved in dealing SHW complaints in the ICs.  The procedures were followed properly, the case was conclusive and aggrieved women received justice through the Internal Committee in the Security Force of Central Government and 2 Medical Colleges and Hospitals. In one case of the central government organisation, ICs had to take Ex-parte decision due to absence of complainant in three consecutive hearings and in another case, the IC has submitted report of the preliminary inquiry to the disciplinary authority recommending the need for final inquiry as the IC has found merit in the complaint during the preliminary inquiry. As a result of Sanhitas advocacy, a central government organisation employing a large number of women has launched its online complaint format on SHW.   In the capacity of Support Group and Advisor In the past one year, Sanhita also provided the technical support to the Presiding Officers, Members and External Members. On 10th February, 2023, Sanhita conducted a centralised training for the ICs from 9 government department/organisations, 19 non-government organisations and 8 private organisations through centralised training. In these committees, Sanhita does not represent as external members. As a result of Sanhitas role as a support group and advisor, the following outcomes could be achieved. In two complaints from two different eminent Universities, Sanhita provided legal advice and counselling support to the aggrieved persons who approached the organisation directly. A group of engineering students (both female & male) lodged a mass complaint against one of the faculty members to the IC of their university. The complainants also approached media houses. Sanhita assisted the senior journalists from a renowned media house who reached out to Sanhita in order to understand the ethics and strategy of reporting the mass complaint on SHW.    7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. Reaching out to women workers The employers are reluctant to give access to the casual, unorganised and marginal workers within their organisations. When it comes to ensuring safe workplaces for women employees, the  Oak Progress Report.    8 employers accountability extends to only women working in offices. Though the industries are dependent on the women workers in their factories, mills and plantations these women dont exist in their policies and there is no eagerness to change the status quo of this invisibility. The only way for Sanhita to access the women workers is through strategic partnerships with trade unions working with them or with NGO which are either directly working with them or working with the communities that they are part of. It has been rather challenging to raise the issue of sexual harassment in such public forum which is a first of its kind experience for the mill workers. Working with the Unions The unions being patriarchal structures are not too keen to work with feminist/womens groups. They are also weary of NGOs in general and are skeptical about what results a collaboration can yield. Sanhitas strategic partnership with Nagarik Mancha and its persistent endeavours helped in not only breaking the ice with the unions but also bringing different unions together on a common platform. Working closely with the unions, Sanhita was able to reach the women workers.   Crisis Intervention Experiences of Complainants Almost all complainants have been experiencing Character assassination, humiliation and hostile work environment irrespective of their designation, employment status & work sector. Sanhita experiences the following concern areas in dealing SHW complaints as a support group & advisor: Challenges in following Inquiry Procedure  In most of the cases, Sanhita experienced lack of technical knowhow about inquiry procedure among IC members. ICs where Sanhita is not the External member were also unaware about the SHW issue. Knowledge Gap among Aggrieved Sanhita noted a knowledge gap among students who approached Sanhita for legal advice and counseling support. The engineering students were definitely empowered, but, were found to be lacking even in basic information about their rights laid down in the 2013 Act. They also did not have any understanding about how to deal with such harassment.  ICs not Equipped In two complaints, where Sanhita has played a support role, the ICs were not equipped enough to handle the complaints. Sanhita identified the gaps in Technical knowledge, like process of inquiry, service  rules of the organization, legal aspects etc and also found lacunae in documentation process. As a result of this, the aggrieved faced hostility from their ICs. Non-cooperative Authority /Administration Aggrieved also faced non-cooperation from the Authority/Administration in both the education institutes.    7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective To enhance the organisational capacity for better project management, improved measurement of outcomes and diversifying the fund base     Oak Progress Report.    9   7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Being part of the process of developing the Theory of Change for the Oaks Country Programme was a great learning experience for Team Sanhita. It helped the team understand the gaps in the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning approaches within the organisation. The proposed approach, strategies and interventions in the Tea Gardens were reviewed, fine-tuned, and sharpened during the TOC development process. Sanhitas Organisational ToC is in place: Following this Sanhita also developed an organisational TOC with the help of NIITI Consulting. This helped the team in structuring and streamlining all aspects of the work and in clearly defining expected outputs and outcomes. Sanhitas projects have become more outcome oriented. Sanhita has also arrived at a template for its work through which it is able to simultaneously achieve all the following results:  Reach out to women workers directly and hear their voices and concerns.  Implement interventions on a Pilot basis and evaluate outcomes.  Document outcomes, progress and learnings and disseminate it with key stakeholders as well as a wider audience.  Share all of the above and continue its evidence-based advocacy with relevant stakeholders. In keeping with its commitment to expand its fund base, Sanhita had secured a second funding from Paul Hamlin Foundation (PHF). This project has successfully completed its first cycle of one year nine months following which there was an external evaluation. On the basis of the recommendations of the evaluation they have agreed to continue the support for another two years. Under the PHF support, Sanhita will reach out and closely work with marginal/frontline workers of Government Department on the issue of safe workplaces. This is also a first of its kind initiative. In response to the increased projects, Sanhitas core team has also expanded with the addition of one more member. Currently efforts are underway to secure another additional funding from within the country. Sanhitas FundRaising Strategy Paper is in place The strategy paper for 2022  2025 outlines Sanhitas Funding Needs, Strategies and Challenges to put the organisation on a sustainable long-term financial footing so that it will be able to deliver on its objective of creating safe workplaces for women workers across sectors. In the financial year 2023-2024, Sanhitas total Annual Budget is INR 70 Lakhs. Considering the organisational capacity and the programmatic needs, Sanhita sets the maximum limit of the organisational annual budget i.e. INR 90 Lakhs in the coming financial years. Sanhita has been adopted multiple strategies for fundraising such as exploring the contacts with international and national level donor agencies/organisations who would support work in the area of safety of women workers, developing partnership with select government departments, private organisations, employers associations, NGOs, trade unions or education institutes who are willing to sponsor or share costs of training  programmes and planning to collaborate with the organisations at national level involved in research related to women workers issue where Sanhita can bring its technical expertise and domain knowledge of sexual harassment at workplace.  (Strategy Paper is attached as Annexure)  Oak Progress Report.    10 Major Outcome In the second cycle, Sanhita approached the Paul Hamlyn Foundation with an innovative and challenging proposal of working directly with Anganwadi Workers in two districts of West Bengal. In addition, Sanhita will do advocacy with the monitoring and relevant government departments for creating safe workplaces for frontline workers. The Paul Hamlyn Foundation is supporting this new domain of Sanhitas work for the next two years (April, 2023  March, 2025).  In the past one year, Sanhita has established the programme specific partnership with Department of Panchayat & Rural Development, Indian Jute Mill Association and an NGO named Nari O Sishu Kalyan Kendra for different initiatives.      7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  The issue of safe workplaces and rights of women workers not the priority of the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)  The scope of Sanhitas work has a limited funding opportunities, a very few donor could be identified who would be interested to support issue of SHW and rights of women workers  It is difficult to raise support for this kind of work which does not have quick tangible outcomes. The issue moreover is tied to workplace dynamics and the employers/organisations among other stakeholders hesitate to support the cause as this might lead to clash of interest   Sanhita does not encourage online donation from the individuals/associations in the context of stringent FC & IT rules & regulations  Sanhita has been receiving requests to conduct training from public sector, central government, private organisations, NGOs and state government departments. But some state government departments and private organisations offer no or a very nominal amount of facilitation fees. But for strategic reason and visibility, Sanhita accepts such offer from some important government departments. Sometimes it becomes difficult to select organisations and balance between the visibility & fund generation.             Being a small organisation with limited human resources, it is often challenging to balance between the existing project commitments and training assignments against fees as part of the fundraising.    8.",

Objective 1 Objective Increase legal knowledge, access to socio-economic rights, and capacity to use grievance redressal mechanisms for tea plantation workers in Brahmaputra Valley, Assam (timeframe: 3 years).    7.1.b. Objective 1 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  Changemakers Program in Assam: The Changemakers Program was launched in Assam in April 2022 by Nazdeeks grantee partner, PAJHRA. The purpose was to support 14 Adivasi youth to build knowledge and capacity towards holistic leadership skills. They were provided 6 in-person residential trainings, 2.5 days long each, covering sessions on (1) culture, history and society, (2) civic education, and (3) skills such as research, writing and reporting. Each training was followed by supervised field work in communities, wherein the participants conducted Focus Group Discussions, Individual structured interviews and submitted 4 reports per participant in the duration of the Program. Each of the reports were a part of their homework, which involved field work on a selected issue (such as the Public Distribution System or Anganwadi) and then preparing a report to document the activity and analyse the results. To culminate the program, 08 of the fellows were taken on an Exposure Visit where they visited historical monuments and interacted with organisations such as DISHA, Durbar, and Jana Sanghati Kendra. The idea behind the visit was to provide a chance to these Adivasi youths hailing from remote plantations and with limited opportunities for travel and urban exposure to learn about metropolitan lifestyles, Indian art and history, and to gain a wider understanding of socio-economic issues and CSO based interventions outside the plantations space and with demographies other than Adivasis. Of the 14 participants, 09 were women and 05 were men; most hailing from a social work and legal education background. The syllabus, pedagogy, design and monitoring, and selection process was developed under the guidance of subject matter experts such as Prof. Virginius Xaxa. For each session, training modules (15 in total) were created. In terms of the progress in achieving Objective 1, as the first in a three-year process, this Program was successful. Based on the skills mapping and expectation analysis conducted with the cohort, it is evident that they increased, and in certain subjects acquired first time knowledge, on matters of Indian governance structure, entitlements on health, food, labour, grievance redressal systems, information applications, issues-stakeholder-risk analysis, desk and field research and writing. Significantly, as is also reflected in the Most Significant Change stories attached herewith, they developed and strengthened critical thinking, public speaking, networking and outreach skills and grew demonstrably in confidence and self-respect. Motivated by the learnings, participants from the program have gone on to work as Accredited Social Healthcare Activists in tea plantations, gender committee President of tea worker womens collectives, while some are conducting independent research on Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme for tea workers, have enrolled in graduate level Labour Economic courses, and have become more active as members of workers collectives. In various feedback sessions, the participants have shown a keenness to work within their community and on issues concerning tea workers at large in their professional or individual capacity, as feasible. Other Capacity Building Activities, Community Consultations, Meeting with line departments:  Oak Progress Report.    3 Approximately 34 capacity building, trainings of trainers, and community consultations were carried out by PAJHRA, with technical support from Nazdeek. Out of these, 04 offline and 03 online consultations were held to study the new labour regime and state rules, and formal comments thereto were submitted to the Labour Welfare Department, Assam. To commensurate the efforts, 07 meetings were held with government line departments (E.g. District offices of National Health Mission, Department of Health & Family Welfare, Social Welfare, Gaon Panchayat and local Police Units; State level Directorate of Social Welfare and NHM Headquarters) on issues connected with maternal health and maternity benefits, ration, sexual harassment at workplace, tea garden hospitals by community members and women collectives representatives. The participants of the listed exercises included PAJHRA staff and volunteers, women and student collectives leaders and women community members. Through this process of knowledge sharing on entitlements, recording ongoing issues and grievances, identifying redressal strategies, and sharing the same with communities, PAJHRA staff, volunteers, and women collective leaders were not only able to enhance their own understanding of entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms (helpline numbers, postal complaints and in-person complaints submission directed primarily towards ration services, healthcare including maternal and child, Anganwadi system), they were also alongside able to strengthen and expand their rapport with communities. For the communities, at this stage of the project, it led to an increased awareness of their entitlements, approaches and processes to access them and filing grievances, and learning through direct demonstration by guided visits/helpline calls to authorities for filing complaints, advocacy, and seeking information from the authorities.  In Dibrugarh for instance, PAJHRAs field educators organised community meetings with Aanganwadi Workers (AWWs) and ASHA workers for pregnant and lactating women, where the latter filed their grievances before the AWCs, shared their mutual challengesespecially those related to documentation and form filling. As a follow up, they persuaded the ASHA to accompany them to their sub-center to review the status of their maternity cash entitlement applications as per official records, submit additional documents, and file complaints over non-payment of cash installments. Following this, of the 10 partcipants, 3 received partial instalments, 2 full instalments, and the remaining were able to submit necessary documents. Some of the other key impacts observed included formation of unit committees of the womens collective in Dibrugarh, Nagaon, and Golaghat Districts, and initiatives taken by women community members and collectives leaders to address their grievances, especially those related to pregnant and lactating women, through meetings with government representatives. For instance, in a community meeting held in Duliajan (Dibrugarh), 28 women community members identified inadequate food, nutrition, clothing and shelter, expensive and inadequate medical services, poor and inaccessible education as main issues plaguing the tea plantation workers. They were aided in the issue identification process by PAJHRAs field educator and by the local ASHA, AWWs, AWW helpers, and Auxiliary Nursing Midwife (ANM) who had especially been invited as government representatives to this meeting for information exchange, advocacy, and grievance resolution purposes. The community members discussed best options for their advocacy on the identified issues and decided to tackle them by way of collectives. The collectives leaders (who were also present in the meeting) explanation of the purpose, process, and impact of womens collectives played an important role in this decision. They observed that collectives strength and resources were necessary to support them in elevating their grievances to the government office bearers. Thus, they collectively decided to form a unit committee of the collective at Duliajan Gaon Panchayat and a regional committee at Duliajan. Scoping for local partner organisations: During the reporting period, Nazdeek engaged in scoping for partner organisations in Assam and has identified 3 potential partners, including one in the Barak Valley. Owing to the prevailing situation, the progress on this activity has been gradual with great emphasis on financial and legal due diligence. We are also conferring with experts, current local partner organisations and  Oak Progress Report.    4 collectives to help us identify the way forward in Assam. Nazdeek intends to complete the reassessment and reorientation of its Assam engagement by the end of this year.      7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. The current legal and policy conditions have been the primary challenge during the reporting period. Increasing threats to human rights defenders have also affected the pace and depth of work. The suspension of PAJHRAs FCRA certificate in October affected program activities in the last quarter of the project. While Nazdeek was able to ensure completion of the Changemakers program through another grantee, the other remaining activity (exposure visit for women collective members) was withdrawn from the project as it was considered neither prudent nor feasible to conduct the same. Despite the above situation, it may be noted that Nazdeek was able to accomplish all activities committed to by it in year 1 of the grant. With the continued suspension of PAJHRAs FCRA certificate, Nazdeek is currently reassessing its strategy in Assam, in consultation with relevant experts and the Oak Foundation. At the grantees level, a program at the scale of the Changemakers program was novel to them and served as a sharp learning curve for their team. They experienced logistical and coordination challenges in the initial part of the program. As expertise on certain subjects is limited within the community, they initially struggled to identify resource persons. But with Nazdeeks technical guidance and support from experts based outside of Assam, they were able to overcome these issues during the 2nd quarter of the project. Ensuring women community members participation in community and collective activities, especially in new project areas was also a challenge faced by the grantee. In order to overcome the same, the grantee staff engaged in dedicated outreach and rapport building and also utilised the support of women collectives leaders.      7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective Enhance capacity of local civil society organisations in Barak Valley to bring greater access to socio-economic rights to tea plantation workers (timeframe: 3 years).       7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).   Oak Progress Report.    5 Nazdeek, as per the year one commitment, engaged in scoping for a partner in Barak Valley. We conducted this activity through consultations with our existing partners and networks, subject matter experts, community collectives active in the region to build a list of potential partners. In pursuance of the same, we visited an organisation in Barak Valley, interacted with their Director and Board Member, office staff to better understand their approach and current work. We are also exploring possibilities of our current partners being able to support us in activities in the Barak Valley. Due to the ongoing situation, Nazdeek is doing careful considerations in legal and financial compliances and making gradual progress on this objective. Nazdeek intends to complete the reassessment and reorientation of its Assam engagement by the end of this year, and this will include the finalisation of a partner for the Barak Valley part of the project, if the new engagement plan allows the same.    7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. As mentioned earlier, the current legal and policy conditions have forced us to take a measured approach towards this objective in Year 1. We are following the advice of financial and legal compliance experts in the matter and for now intend to continue our scoping activity in Year two.    7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective Enhance capacity of local civil society organisations through training of trainers in West Bengal to bring greater access to socio-economic rights to tea plantation workers (timeframe: 3 years).    7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  As this is Nazdeeks first grantee-based initiative in West Bengal, this Objective and especially the activities in Year 1, were crafted to combine scoping and baseline studies on tea workers issues in North Bengal and a need-based training of trainers (ToT) model for the grantee. After an initial baseline study (attached herewith) conducted in 9 tea plantations, focusing on issues and context mapping, our grantee BMJ with Nazdeeks technical support, was able to (1) identify ToT topics and design, (2) select Cha Sundari Scheme (a tea workers housing scheme launched by WB government in 2022) for field research and report writing, (3) identify line departments for consultations, and (4) identify topics for filing Right to Information (RTI) applications where official guidelines and data was required for any further activities. Based on the above, 4 ToTs were conducted on Indian Governance and Legal structures for entitlements; Right to Information; Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace; and on Anti-Gender Discrimination. The participants for these trainings included consultants associated with grantee, community members, and leaders of community collectives. 4 training modules were also  Oak Progress Report.    6 developed for the purpose of the ToTs. These trainings allowed for systematic knowledge sharing, which was further transferred to communities via community meetings by the participants. The trainings also helped the grantee in assessing the current levels of knowledge on issues and policies among community leaders and members, and in further refining the project. The training participants, especially after the trainings on sexual harassment and gender discrimination, resolved to (a) be more vigilant of such cases in their plantations and to record and track the same, (b) conduct awareness exercises with the community, especially women and their families, (c) use strategies such as RTI filing and engagement with plantation management and local officials over non-compliance with the POSH Act. Further, at least 120 community consultations were carried out by the grantee across 30 plantations. Topics ranged from the need to collectivize on common issues, formulating workers claimsespecially for gratuity and provident fundavailable grievance redressal mechanisms, maternity benefits and entitlements, prevention of harassment at the workplace and reporting mechanisms, etc. These consultations enhanced the workers and the communities understanding of their issues and how they must be understood, how to identify and utilize available resources, and a clearer knowledge of utilization of policies and systems pertaining to their work. Following the trainings, 5 RTIs were filed by the training participants and grantee consultants on the Cha Sundari scheme. 4 meetings were conducted by the Grantee, workers collectives leaders, and local legal experts with relevant officials from the Housing and Labour Departments to understand the technicalities of Cha Sundari scheme and the progress in drafting of rules to the new labour codes by the West Bengal government. The RTI responses and information received through meetings contributed in the development of the Cha Sundari Report that was launched in January 2023. This report is to be utilized for generating scheme related awareness among community members and to help them draft and establish claims thereunder. As the report states, there is ambiguity at the policy level for this scheme and the grantee intends to engage with the relevant authorities to clarify the same and advocate for changes where required. Further, as an impact of the meetings with the line departments, the grantee was invited to prepare draft rules on labour codes and submit the same to them in order to support the governments own drafting process. With technical support from Nazdeek, the grantee developed and submitted draft rules on (1) Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code and (2) a summary of on the remaining two codes and (3) state amendment recommendations for all 04 codes. These were submitted to the Office of the Deputy Labour Commissioner, Alipurduar. In year two, the grantee intends to continue engagement with the government departments in the drafting and finalization of these rules which will have a wide-ranging impact on tea workers status and entitlements.      7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. The challenges faced during Year 01 were: 1. Difficulty in maintaining a steady and consistent cohort. The remoteness of the plantations, limited transport options, and the loss of a days wage for participants in order to attend the trainings posed a challenge for the grantee. This was especially an obstacle in participation of women. As a consequence, most trainings had to be held on weekends and intensive planning had to be undertaken for arranging the logistics and ensuring attendance. For the Year two, a process similar to Changemakers program is being considered to maintain consistency of participation.     Oak Progress Report.    7 2. Challenges in financial coordination. As the project area and head office of the grantee were not close and the latter itself was based in a small town, it became a challenge for the staff and consultants to coordinate on financial matters, for example submission of bills and receipts had to be undertaken manually and the regularity of the same was affected. Owing to this challenge, it was decided by Nazdeek to identify a more suitable grantee. Thus, Durbar has been selected and we are currently conducting its financial due diligence.       7.4.a. Objective 4 Objective Enhance national-level advocacy on labour laws and business and human rights (timeframe: 3 years).    7.4.b. Objective 4 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  In year 01 of the grant period, Nazdeek facilitated three consultations on draft rules to the four labour codes, as issued by the Assam government. Representatives of Assam tea workers, civil society organisations, student and womens collectives participated in these discussions. This activity was undertaken under the aegis of the Assam chapter of the Forum for Rights of Tea Workers and comments to all 04 draft rules were submitted. As the draft rules published by the Assam government were not given wide publicity and the deadline for comments submission was unlawfully short, this group, in a meeting with the Principal Secretary, Labour Department sought an extension of the deadline and also translation of the same into Assamese (official language of Assam) to ensure widespread accessibility. As an impact of the meeting, the deadline for the submission of the comments was extended by almost 2 months. At the national level, Nazdeek provided strategic and technical support to its West Bengal grantee in their advocacy in favour of workers claims before Justice Sapre Committee. This is a one-man committee instituted by the Supreme Court of India to assess claims for workers dues in closed and sick tea plantations in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Through our network, we supported the grantee in connecting with workers and petitioners in Assam, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu and in assessing the ground realities. This was especially the case between our West Bengal and Tamil Nadu partners, and our Assam and West Bengal partners who were able to meet and discuss strategies towards collaborative advocacy for the coming years. The impact of these activities is visible in the Supreme Courts recent order directing payment of Rs. 650 crores to 25 tea plantations workers in Assam as their legal and rightful dues, where partnerships between our grantees/partners played a crucial role in securing the workers claims.            7.4.c. Objective 4 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made.  Oak Progress Report.    8 The main challenge to attaining this objective has been the legal and policy climate around tea industry and consequent impact on the civil society spaces. We and our partners are making careful considerations to work in full compliance with the laws of the land. The delay in the enforcement of the new central codes, and in the formulation of rules thereunder by the central and state governments has also affected our plans of national-level legislative advocacy. Irrespective, all our grantees and partners are in the meantime dedicated to ensuring that vast majority of our communities have an understanding of these laws and their implications, so that we are able to ensure their participation in the legislative drafting process once it resumes. We continue to seek common ground and initiatives for the fulfillment of this grant objective on other issues as well.    7.5.a. Objective 5 Objective Strengthen civil society in the regional and global tea sectors (timeframe: 3 years).       7.5.b. Objective 5 Progress. What progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on progress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities occurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  During year 01 of the grant period, Nazdeek conducted 3 scoping visits within South Asia, with 01 each in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The purpose of these visits was to meet with potential partners, understand their work and our mutual synergies, as well as to conduct initial scoping visits in tea plantations to acquaint ourselves with country-specific contexts and status of tea workers within the industry and the legal regime. In each of these countries, we also met workers and their representatives and received information on the current collective bargaining norms and processes in place. In Nepal, we conducted meetings with 3 organisations (2 in Kathmandu, 1 in Jhapa) and visted 3 tea plantations; in Bangladesh, we met with 2 organisations, one of whom is an existing grantee, and visited 3 tea plantations; in Sri Lanka, we met with 2 organisations and visited 2 tea plantations. At this stage, in Bangladesh we have identified a partner organisation and are in the process of assessing others in Nepal and Sri Lanka. In order to strengthen intra-regional understanding, cooperation, and development of a common demand of tea workers, their representatives and concerned CSOs, the inaugural session of the South Asia chapter of Forum for Rights of Tea Workers (FRTW-SA) was organised in Sri Lanka on May 21, 2023. The participants hailed from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia (observer). The day-long discussion saw the participants provide updates on the most pressing workers issues in their regions and identified common factors and impacts at an intra-regional level. The issues identified were non-fixation of minim wages and dilution of collective bargain power within the region, the increasing informalization of the tea work with the rise of small tea growers, womens socio-economic status and low representation despite being the majority tea workers, and lack of housing title for tea workers across the region. The participants, as next steps, agreed to have (1) a 2nd session of FRTW-SA early next year to discuss coalition structure and standard; (2) engage in bilateral collaborations and comparative studies on tea workers and entitlements to enhance mutual understanding and areas of cooperation. Further, the participants were also able to attend the Malaiyagam event commemorating 200 years of tea and migration/employment of Tamil workers in  Oak Progress Report.    9 up-country plantations in Sri Lanka. This event served as an opportunity for us to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and aspirations of the tea workers community in Sri Lanka and allowed us to meet their representatives and relevant experts. We were also able to contribute to the drafting of the final Declaration of the Malaiyagam, especially on points of women workers entitlements, housing and land, and on collective bargaining processes.    7.5.c. Objective 5 Challenges and obstacles. We expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  Please share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. The primary challenges faced were: 1. In Nepal, as our desk and field research revealed, there are no organisations helmed by workers or otherwise, that are working specifically and directly on the entitlements of tea workers. There are unions that are active but they carry strong political party affiliations. Keeping the above in mind, we are looking to first develop knowledge partnerships with organisations that work on socio-economic issues with similar demographies and build rapport with workers representatives, especially women. 2. The organisation of FRTW-SA posed unique challenges in terms of legal technicalities and logistics in a foreign country. We had to spend considerable organisational time and effort in understanding the legal complexities involved and in arranging travel partners for logistical purposes.   8.",
        "Significant changes": "Significant changes. If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular objective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key staffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   * Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be commented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report. This reporting period has been challenging for a number of reasons. Some of them are as follows:  Political, Legislative, and Civil Challenges: Due to the ongoing political, legislative, and civil instability within the country, we and our partners have been experiencing heightened pressures and have had to scale back on work to address the current challenges. While continuing to support projects and grantee organizations, we have in the last few months focused towards strengthening our communication and data policies, revamping and updating our data security systems, and collaborating with area experts to ensure security of our consultants and partners. Due to the probable risks being faced by community-led organizations that are associated in different capacities, we are undertaking new ways of doing our work to ensure the safety of all parties involved.  Organizational Restructuring: In light of the current circumstances and long-term goals of the organization, Nazdeek has chosen to undergo a phase of organizational restructuring. We have been undertaking workshops, sessions, and consultations on issues related to safeguarding, risk mitigation, communications strategy, and much more. As the organization and the consultants work through this transition, including introduction of new consultants, everyone is learning to adapt to the new systems and methods of work. Despite these challenges, Nazdeek is looking forward to this year as we embark on more scoping visits, support grantees in conducting robust workshops, and provide enhanced technical and research advisory for grantees and communities to utilize. It is expected that this transitional  Oak Progress Report.    10 phase will come to a successful closure this year and the organization will be able to continue its work even more impactfully through its new form.  Grantee Change for Cycle 2 of the Grant: it was observed by Nazdeek that the distance between project areas and the grantees headquarters had led to accounting, coordination, and reporting challenges for the grantee and its field workers under the project. Thus, Nazdeek requested for a change of grantee from Bolpur Manab Jameen to Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee. As Nazdeek had had the opportunity to meet with Durbars leadership and staff and to understand their work, and also had the experience of working with them as a funder for a short grant, Durbar was selected as the grantee for West Bengal leg of the project in Cycle 2 of the grant. This change was also requested to the Oak Foundation and was approved by them. At this point, Durbars financial due diligence has been completed and we have received our CAs approval to go ahead with the organisation as a grantee.  No-cost extensions: Nazdeek had sought and received 2 no-cost extensions from the Oak Foundation. The first was to complete the final remaining activity under the Assam leg of the project, for conducting financial due-diligence of Durbar, and for Nazdeeks audit to be completed. As the auditors in US were not able to complete the process, we had to seek another no-cost extension.   9. Additional question(s): Please use this space to respond to any question(s) sent to you by the Oak programme team.  If none were received, please leave this section blank. The key focus areas for year 2 with indicative milestones are: 1. Enhance knowledge and skills of participants from tea workers community in West Bengal on issues identified in the baseline study and during the first year of project by engaging them in structured training programs so as to develop them into a cohort of at least 6 paralegal volunteers. 2. Strengthening civil society collaboration in regional and global tea sectors by developing a secretariat and common agenda for FRTW by the end of year 2.     II.

        "One Year Progress Report-2023": "3The overall objective of the Project in West Bengal is to improve the livelihoods of tribals, resource poor and other vulnerable communities through promoting sustainable natural resource management and enhancing access to entitlements by building linkages with the Government institutions in 25 forest fringe villages of Ranibandh Block of Bankura District and 12 villages in Sandeshkhali-I block of North 24 Parganas. In this report, briefly we highlight the progress of the project based on the objectives as follows.",
        "Project Objective 1: Formation and Strengthening the Village Level Institutions/ Groups while ensuring Women Leadership in these institutions": ". Graph: Formation and Strengthening of Village Institutions in Ranibandh & Sandheskhali  I Tribal Farmer Service Centres (TFSCs) are formed to provide service and handholding support to the tribal farmers, disseminate information on government schemes, providing agricultural implements to farmers and establish demo-plots on agro-ecological practices and share information to small group farmers. Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) are formed with the existing Government committee (PRI, SHG, Mothers committee, ASHA workers, school management committee etc.) members to make the institutions effective and avail government schemes and entitlements. Theres no overlap of members between TFSCs and VCGs. Though, it was proposed to establish 25 TFSCs in each village but in some villages the habitations were too far from the main village (more than 3 kms.) and it was decided to have additional TFSCs. So, 28 TFSCs were formed. Total 123 monthly TFSC meetings have been conducted as on August 2023 to discuss about the issues pertaining to agriculture and livelihoods in their respective habitations. Similarly, to avail government schemes and entitlements, Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) are formed in 37 habitations spread across Bankura and North 24 Parganas. Out of 89 VCG members in Sandheshkhali  1, 68 members are female and in Ranibandh, 76 members are female out of 250 total VCG members. Through VCGs, awareness meetings and orientations were organized on various existing government schemes like Kanyashree, Rupashree, Swasthya Sathi and Krishak Bandhu, among others. During these meetings, VCG members/community members are also trained on how to file petitions for both individual as well as community needs.  The efforts of our VCG members and field staff have resulted in sanctioning of 15 individual entitlements (ST certificate) out of total 266 petitions submitted to Boyarmari  I Gram Panchayat under Sandeshkhali  I Block, North 24 Parganas. In Ranibandh, 118 (individual as well as community) petitions are submitted to Duare Sarkar and the petitions are yet to be sanctioned.",
        "Project Objective 2: Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water resource development for food & nutritional security": ".Establishment of Demo-PlotsTo promote agro-ecological practices amongst the farmers of Ranibandh block, 33 demo-plots are established out of which 24 are in Barikul GP and the rest are in Ranibandh GP. Out of 33 demo plots, 24 demo plots are established to promote vegetable crops such as cauliflower, pumpkin, cabbage, radish, tomato, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, bean etc. by following agro-ecological practices. Demo plots are owned by the farmers and are in the range of 1  1.5 bighas of land. The demo plots are our farmer field schools (FFS) where the progressive/interested farmers are brought for exposure and training on the agro-ecological practices. 9 plots were established to demonstrate the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method.Table: Details of Farmer Field Schools (FFS) conducted Total 45 FFS are conducted in our project location under Ranibandh block, out of which 13 FFS were conducted under Ranibandh GP and 32 FFS under Barikul GP. Total 518 farmers including 53 women farmers have attended the FFS where the farmers are trained on different package of practices (POPs) for crops. Through FFS, the farmers are also trained on preparing organic pesticides and fertilisers, land preparation, seed treatment, seed sowing techniques, weed control and pest management. FFS is an avenue to learn new knowledge related to agriculture that involves participatory process where farmers learn by doing under the able guidance of our field staff and experts. Liaising with PRIs and other line departments are done through regular sharing of information and meetings. The team members sought the advice of ADA on pest management in pumpkin and also on availing seeds. As the department is distributing only high yielding seeds and not indigenous, they were procured from outside. Agriculture ImplementsTable: Agriculture Implement Given to TFSCs in RanibandhFarmers to ease the burden and reduce the time spent on threshing wanted to procure paddle paddy thresher, weeder and battery sprayer to increase the productivity. TFSCs procured Paddle Paddy Thresher (28), Cono Weeder (28), Battery Sprayer (6 and the remaining TFSCs will be provided soon) and Drums (56).  Promotion of Pulses, Oilseeds and Vegetables During the Kharif season, 619 farmers received vegetable seed (cabbage, pumpkin, okra, horse gram, tomato etc.) support as part of promoting vegetables amongst the tribal farmersSimilarly, during the Rabi season, 26 farmers received mustard seeds of 1 kg on an average out of which the total mustard seed production was 597 kgs. Further, 59 farmers received support to promote kitchen garden. The farmers use high yielding variety of seeds in paddy and indigenous seeds for other crops. The shift to natural farming is a gradual process and so the gradation of change process is followed in CPF. In the initial phase, with few agro-ecological practices are promoted. Farmers are trained and encouraged to apply organic fertilizers (Ghanjeevamritam and Jeevamritam) and organic pesticides (Neemastram and Agniastram). The farmers treat the seeds before sowing by following the process of Beejamritam. Capacitating Maintenance of Watershed Structures Though the area receives good rainfall, the water is not being retained as the watershed structures constructed by government are not functional. So, the farmers are being given trainings on the maintenance of watershed structures. 13 watershed structures were identified for repair and maintenance. 1 water tank was desilted in Parashiya village (Barikul GP) with the project cost of Rs.1.38 lakh and farmers contribution were Rs. 12,000. Around, 180 farmers did Shramdan for 5 days. CPFs intervention had a ripple effect and the communities desilted another tank on their own. Further, they also repaired a check dam by contributing Rs.12000/-. Soil Test To introduce the scientific method of understanding the soil, the farmers were trained on undertaking soil tests. Soil samples were sent for testing to KVK Sonamukhi, Bankura. In the first batch, soil samples of 121 farmers were sent and the result indicated that most of the soil contains high acidic content. The results and recommendations are shared with the farmers to improve the soil health. For instance, if the NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) content is low, the farmers are advised to increase the NPK by applying vermicompost, farm yard manure and green manure.  Another batch of 107 Soil samples have been collected from the farmers and sent for testing. The results are yet to come.",
        "Project Objective 3: Enhancing access to alternative livelihoods among landless, resource poor and other forest dependent communities": ".As majority of the communities (70%) are dependent upon Non-Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) for additional incomes, it is imperative that the communities are made aware about the importance of forest and their conservation. Towards this end, CPF has conducted 5 trainings on sustainable harvesting of NTFPs and value addition. Local experts and forest department officials were involved as resource persons to provide awareness to the NTFP collectors of our project villages. NTFP collectors were informed about the negative impacts of over harvesting of NTFPs and the need for value addition (leaf plate making, pickles etc.) to fetch more incomes. As far as marketing of the NTFPs are concerned, the project staff has explored different options by speaking and consulting number of persons/organizations such as the DFO of Bankura South Division, Ranibandh Range Officer, PRADAN, traders and NTFP collectors themselves. Two of our community field facilitators (CFFs) were trained on leaflet making and are aware of markets linkages. So, CPF is exploring to reestablish the market linkages through them and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in each GP under Ranibandh Block for the marketing of NTFPs. As suggested, TRIFED option also will be explored. To enhance the income of landless, resource poor and single headed households, backyard poultry farming has been promoted. 42 community members from Ranibandh and Barikul were provided with poultry of local breed (3 each). Awareness meetings on Forest Rights Act (FRA-2006) are being conducted at the village level to make them aware about the Community Forest Rights (CFR) and the claim process. CPF has built rapport and collaborated with the Forest Department in plantation and value addition of NTFPs. The SDLC through Block Land Records Office (BLRO)/BDO has distributed IFR titles few years ago but in our operational areas no CFR titles have been submitted. The West Bengal Tribal Development Portal mentions that in Bankura district 210 CFRs have been distributed (https://adibasikalyan.gov.in/forest-right-act ) and we are trying to know where these titles are given. In the next year, we are planning to submit CFR claims in our villages after the formation of Forest Rights Committees (FRCs).",
        "Project Objective 4: Enabling project communities to access and avail their constitutional rights and entitlements": ".During the VCG meetings (as highlighted in the 1st Objective), project communities are made aware about the existing Government services and entitlements. To build rapport between the community and the government representatives, various programs and meetings are held. The World Environment Day was celebrated at Chendhapathar village on June 5th 2023 which was participated by forest officials, local intellectuals, school children and other community members. In collaboration with the forest department, plant saplings are distributed amongst the project communities. Plantations were carried out by TFSC members in school compounds, ICDS centres, Dam/pond bund at Parashya and few at individual agricultural plots. ChallengesIn West Bengal, the government officials are not accepting filing of petitions on a regular basis for social security programs and entitlements and they are only accepting during the Duare Sarkar camps and they are also not being held regularly.  We have approached the Right to Food and Work Network (RTFWN) and planning to meet them at the earliest. In Sandeshkhali area, the bureaucratic hurdles in getting permission to operate in villages has taken considerable time and energy. However, now in all the 12 villages, we got permission to operate.    It took some time to ground the project but with persons having agriculture qualifications and experience has helped in grounding the project at faster pace. This Kharif season, due to prolonged dry spell coupled with extreme heat, the vegetable crops in few villages got damaged."
