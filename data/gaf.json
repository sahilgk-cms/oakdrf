        "5. ORGANISATION CONTEXT": "6. Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, governance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):There is much discrimination in our society based on economic condition, gender, caste, age, educational qualification etc. We believe that being treated equally with dignity is the basic thing one should expect from the society. With a vision of a transformed society built on equity, dignity and peace Rupantaran Foundation was formed in 2009 as not for profit, non-political organization. The word Rupantaran literally means the process of positive transformation. As our name suggests we are facilitating an empowering process of transformation towards equality, dignity and peace with the disadvantaged people to shape a just, equitable and nonviolent world. Presently we are directly operating in 4 blocks of Sunderbans in South 24 Parganas district and Kolkata in West Bengal on the issues of child protection, gender equity, education, and livelihoods. Our aim is to build leadership, enable social justice and promote responsive citizenship among communities through engaging young people, women and marginalized people. Rupantaran also works as a resource and capacity building organisation for social partners and institutes. Rupantaran Foundation is registered as a Society under West Bengal Societies Registration Act XII of 1860, bearing Registration Number S/1L/60699 of 2009  10. The Society is governed by a Governing Body comprising 8 members: Ms Shruti Kundu (President), Mr Himangshu Das (Vice President)  Mr Abhishek (Secretary), Ms Debjani Barman (Assistant Secretary), Mr Snehasish Sarkar (Treasurer), Mr Gajendra Kumar (Member), Ms Jayati Mal (Member) and Ms Urmita Ghosh (Member).  Director Ms Smita Sen is currently leading Rupantaran. The organization has Program Coordinator, Supervisor, Field Worker along with a considerable number of paid volunteers.Grant Application Form, July 1 201356b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):The financial situation of Rupantaran Foundation has been on a growing curve with every passing year, especially after receiving the FCRA registration.  In previous year, the annual operating costs of the organization was around 67 lakhs and this financial year its expected to reach 1 crore. Rupantaran Foundation is grassroots implementing organisation as well as it serves as resource organisation. One of Rupantarans modes of raising funds for its programme initiatives are to provide knowledge services to likeminded organizations operating in the development sector.Along with that Rupantaran Foundation has good individual donors base which serves as a backbone and cope with shock in any sudden change in funding context e.g. recent FCRA amendment. Also, Rupantaran is supported by few individuals who have provided us with Corpus Fund which will act as a reserve for maintaining its core program and team. As on date, Rupantaran Foundation doesnt have any outstanding debts.6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Despite representing a large proportion of the population, adolescent and youth are widely excluded from the decision making process, as they have limited access to information, space and opportunity to acquire and share knowledge, and limited participation. In this light, Rupantaran Foundation has started its journey in 2009 aims to create a safe space, where marginalization cease to exist, and adolescent and youth can build their own agency and voice their opinion. We started our journey from a single village in Sundarbans. Through participatory vulnerability and capacities analysis and micro plan with the youth, the need for working on education, prevention of early marriage and child labour etc. were pointed out as the menace to be fought against. In that time, our team along with those youth designed and shaped the initial programmes of Rupantaran. Gradually, along with young people we started engaging with women and other marginalized communities and activating government delivery mechanisms and bodies. Past Achievements:Two of our youth collective members from remote villages from South 24 Parganas received the Bravery Award, 2020 from West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights for their extraordinary community development work during pandemic.Grant Application Form, July 1 20136 In one of the panchayat where we did our pilot work with VLCPCs, the VLCPCs over the period of 3 years addressed 11 cases of trafficking, 200 cases of child marriage, 97 cases of dropout prevention and 70 cases of gender based violence (including eve teasing). A sample of 220 adolescents and youth with whom we worked reached out to 11818 peers, 3652 family members and 3527 community members on awareness on Child Marriage, Trafficking, Reproductive Health Rights, Gender equity, Education and Online Safety.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Rupantarans key strategies are:1) Collectivisation and creating safe spaces for the marginalised2) Strengthening the local governance   We believe that collectivizing or bringing together the marginalized people in a safe space enable them to articulate their oppression and strategize for individual and social change. In rural areas, especially in Sundarbans there is a crunch of space to engage the marginalised people in the social development processes as the politics of spaces significantly plays its role in allowing and rejecting dialogues and discussions. For us at Rupantaran, creation of safe space was not about creating a physical space rather, creating a socio-cultural and psychological space where marginalization would cease to exist, celebrates a bond of trust, encourages building their own agency and facilitating a platform for a transformative journey from self to society.6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):The development landscape of backward areas such as the Sundarbans points at a glaring dearth of people-centred processes and sustainable initiatives of change. While a number of development interventions are being implemented in the Sundarbans, the relative degrees of participation and leadership of local communities, especially those hailing from vulnerable sections, appears to be low. There seems a significant scope for assimilation of an agenda for nurturance of people-centred agencies of change, for greater sustainability of interventions and empowerment of peoples agencies. The proposed intervention aims at addressing the non-availability of a facilitative Grant Application Form, July 1 20137platform for vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to come together, diagnose their vulnerabilities and act upon the same. Such a platform has been elusive on account of high opportunity cost of participation of vulnerable groups in processes of development, lack of any favourable prior experiences, and increasing alienation from their core habitat and livelihoods. The proposed thrust of the intervention, i.e. creating enabling conditions for specific groups of vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to assess and act upon their vulnerabilities, is likely to pose multiple challenges to facilitating agencies. The challenges were identified through the participatory vulnerabilities and capacities analysis along with micro plan. This includes related to mobilisation of vulnerable groups amidst their day-to-day struggles, finding acceptance within the community for a slow process of change, and potential resistance on the part of powerful vested interests. Internally, these include the challenge of restraint needed on the part of facilitating agencies, especially at the frontline level, in order that they do not pre-determine the directions of the process and allow the same to emerge naturally from the community level processes and perspectives of vulnerable groups. Other challenges relate to probable gaps in understanding and commitment needed to a rights-based community-led approach to development, or probable non-availability of necessary skills of facilitation at the frontline level, among others.  The proposed intervention offers a great opportunity for strategic leveraging of available strengths of other identified organizations, towards creation of pathways for emergence of peoples agency for sustainable change.",

Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, governance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Terre des hommes Foundation, based in Lausanne, is a member of the Terre des Hommes International Federation, which includes sister organisations worldwide. Its Executive Board's role is to oversee the organisation of the Foundation and to monitor ongoing activities, administration, use of the Foundation's resources, risk management and regulation. 2019 was marked by a major financial crisis requiring a reduction in the volume of expenditure in order to guarantee the sustainability of the organization while ensuring the continuity of operations. Measures were taken to adjust priorities at the level of each programme, leading to the restructuring of the operational procedures of the Children in Humanitarian Crisis programme, which is now managed by a single Operations Department in order to promote coordination between emergency, rehabilitation and development activities; and to the termination of certain programmes (Child Labour Exploitation, Advocacy in Switzerland). The HQ Operations department has been restructured into 4 portfolios: Africa, MENA, Asia-South America-Europe and FAST (dedicated to humanitarian crisis). This new organization supports project implementation in a more efficient way, without changing roles and responsibilities at country level. Tdh started its work in India in 1976; the India Delegation Office was established in 2008 as a Liaison Office which implements its programmes and projects through local partner organisations. The office is led by the Country Representative with a Team consisting of Programme Managers of the main thematic areas, supported by Programme Officers and other programme and office assistance staff. Strengthened by its resilience and commitment of its 2059 national and expatriates employees and volunteers worldwide, Tdh has been able to cope with the challenges in this exceptional context in order to maintain its commitment to vulnerable children.6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Tdh, founded in 1960 by Edmund Kaiser in Lausanne, is a leading Swiss child rights organisation that was born during the Algerian conflict to provide direct help to children in need. Tdh is active in over 40 countries worldwide. In India, Tdh has been working since 2008 in the areas of Child Protection, Mother and Grant Application Form, July 1 20136Child Health, WASH and Emergency Response. Tdh co-manages a Global Safeguarding and Support Hub, supported by UK Aid and has been awarded Level 1 certification from Keeping Children Safe.1.PM+: In 2019, Tdh successfully rolled-out the PM+ approach, a brief psychological intervention for adolescents and adults (16+) in Bangladesh. In keeping with WHO Mental Health Global Action Program, PM+ was developed to manualize a brief counseling approach for mild to moderate mental health disorders. The approach focuses on addressing common psychological problems  like stress, anxiety, depression symptoms and where possible, practical problems like livelihood difficulties, family discords etc.2.Art-based methodology (YouCreate toolkit) for youth participation and social cohesion: The toolkit (Art-kit) has been developed by the International Institute for Child Rights and Development to train youth champions and their adult allies to use various kinds of arts to support children and young peoples psychosocial wellbeing. Lessons learnt from this project in Egypt and Iraq can be adapted and applied to support young peoples participation and build their self-confidence, resilience and empowerment in various contexts.3.Sport for Protection Toolkit: Programming with Young People in Forced Displacement Settings is the result of a multi-agency collaboration between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Olympic Committee and Tdh. The toolkit focuses on three key protection outcomes: Social inclusion; Social cohesion; and Psychosocial well-being. The methodology has been successfully used in Iran, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Palestine, Egypt, Georgia, Eastern Europe and India. 6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):India has 450 million internal migrants (2011 census), an increase of 45% since 2001. Of this, 68% are women. A study[1] conducted by Association for Stimulating Know-how showed that West Bengal and Jharkhand are among the states from where women migrate for work in high numbers. Children migrate either alone or with their family to work. While migration does not necessarily lead to trafficking, it creates conditions which make migrating women and children more vulnerable to being traf?cked for sexual exploitation/labour.The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these vulnerabilities, putting children and young people at increased risk of trafficking and exploitation.Arriving at a new place, the survivors are cut off from the outside world and forced Grant Application Form, July 1 20137to live in prison-like conditions by their captors. Documents of identification and money are immediately seized, and their movements restricted and continuously monitored. Repeated violence triggers suicidal tendencies and trauma in many survivors. Rescue typically occurs through police raids, help from clients, or captors releasing the survivors due to age, health conditions, etc. However, their trauma does not end with withdrawal.What follows is a chaotic and unprepared journey, into an extremely challenging process of reintegration. Survivors suffer constant terror, guilt, shame and hopelessness. Unaware of service providers and bereft of a social support system, survivors lack adequate occupational skills to begin anew, feel too weak to voice their concerns and consequently, find it impossible to reintegrate into their own society.The study conducted by Tdh highlights survivors experiences of stigma and the hardships they face upon return to their communities, that are major barriers to their successful reintegration.  Continued stigma, denial, rejection in their own communities and lack of preparedness of family members to handle the social stigma leave them feeling crippled and isolated.Tdh has been successfully implementing the Learning Grant supported by Oak Foundation since 2013 and is currently in Phase II of the grant that concludes in October 2020. The grant has supported 35 partners to strengthen their existing practices of working with survivors and support their mental health and wellbeing. It has also supported development of child centric participatory tools (BECOME, EMpowerPLus, Livelihood Precondition) and Counselling Handbook to support frontline workers carrying out the reintegration process.44 social workers have been trained on mental health and counselling that has increased their self-confidence and helped them build a trust-based relationship with children.  In 2019, 1124 children were cared for individually, 445 children were supported to receive services and 6508 family members were counselled and assisted. 1,933 stakeholders were reached through meetings, workshops and consultation including village and block level child protection committees (VL/BL CPCs), Panchayats and Self-Help Groups. The project has engaged with 91 VLCPCs for providing support to children and young people.Partners have been supported to take up joint advocacy initiatives on the gaps in services.Using the seed grant from Tdh, JLKP was able to support 30 young girls and 45 women vulnerable to trafficking earn livelihood through making and selling sal leaf plates, in an initiative supported by the Pradhan and other villagers. This has immensely enhanced the confidence and self-esteem of the girls whose average monthly family income is now between Rs. 6000-7500. With the money earned from selling the plates, some women have also initiated poultry farming and piggeries.  Villagers have also been connected to government schemes such as the Jharkhand Tribal Agency.Using the BECOME and Livelihoods pre-condition tools, GGBK staff are now able to help survivors identify livelihood options and in the last two years, 46 out of 52 girls receiving livelihood support are earning an income and slowly increasing profits.[1] https://www.verite.org/ask-indias-migration-initiatives/",

What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):The project aims to promote inclusive social change by amplifying the voices of tribal households in 8 villages in the SBR region of the North and South 24 Parganas and representing them in research, governance and development interventions. In 4 phases, it aims to (1) enable communities in identifying their vulnerabilities and development needs and aspirations, and assess their Oak Application Form     8vulnerabilities and climate risks, (2) develop community-led interventions to address those needs and aspirations and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change, and (3) implement these interventions through women-led processes, facilitated by like-minded organizations, (4) assess the effectiveness of the interventions and disseminate the knowledge gained with relevant actors.Core Problem: Tribal communities are specifically vulnerable to the effects of climate change and have limited assistance to adapt to climate change.According to researchers from Jadavpur University, the majority of the over 200,000 tribal people in the SBR remain the most resource-poor and vulnerable, inhabiting forest fringe areas characterized by high hazard risks. Predominantly landless and ecosystem-dependent, the tribal households have low adaptive capacity. Efforts to uplift tribal communities in the SBR are underwhelming, with limited research on their situation and needs and few to no interventions support them adapt to climate change. Underlying Problem 1: Needs of tribal communities are unknown and unaddressed as they are not represented in research, policy, governance and leadership.Despite the existence of several pro-tribal policies in India, tribal communities remain largely socioeconomically marginalized and poorly represented in research, policy and governance. Several lacunae in policymaking, such as the mandate that the tribal population of a location/region must be at least 50,000 or 50% of the total population to qualify for pro-tribal schemes and interventions, exclude and further disempower these communities in the SBR, where the tribal population is non-dominant and dispersed. With low levels of participation and leadership, their development needs remain largely unknown and unaddressed. Underlying Problem 2: Tribal communities have limited or no access to interventions and initiatives to reduce their vulnerability to climate change. Due to the lack of alternatives they often rely on indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources and lack sustainable resource management.Being predominantly ecosystem-dependent and non-agrarian, with little to no landholding, makes a significant contribution to the disempowerment of tribal communities, exposing them to man-animal conflict, denial of forest access, and forced migration to urban areas for contractual labour. The loss of livelihood due to natural disasters and lack of sustainable management of natural resources are the main drivers of negative coping strategies adopted by the tribal communities. The consequences of these are emissions from deforested mangrove forests and blue carbon loss, decline of fish, crabs and shrimps, food insecurity and increase of human-animal conflicts. Though the SBR has been globally identified as a key climate change and biodiversity, climate change adaptation for the local communities have been slow and unsustainable, owing primarily to the absence of community-centred approaches and failure to develop sustainable initiatives which are both locally relevant and accessible. From their previous experience of working for the development and protection of vulnerable rural communities in the SBR, both DRCSC and LRRM have noted a dearth of development programs and interventions with a special focus on tribal communities.Oak Application Form     9 Underlying Problem 3: Tribal women are specifically marginalized, experience gender inequality and often face domestic abuse, neglect and deprivation, with no access to mental health care.The disproportionate burden on tribal women remains unaddressed as they are severely marginalized by the existing vulnerabilities, climate-related stresses and gender inequality. They often assume the role of de facto household head in the absence of migrant men, carry overwhelming proportions of care work, while also experiencing domestic abuse, neglect and deprivation. Women and children in the SBR have no recourse to formal mental health support.",

OBJECTIVESThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain what you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We understand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a multitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define your role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss this with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   7.a. ObjectivesList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals that can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are ambitious but also achievable.  Objective: Resilience to climate change among tribal communities is increased through identification of their challenges, their empowerment to active participation in finding solutions for the same and consecutive dissemination of the knowledge gained with relevant actors. Interventions to improve the resilience and living conditions of tribal communities, that are tested, adjusted to the context and identified as effective, are scaled up in terms of geographical and target group outreach through a follow-up project for which funding from private and public institutions is secured.The activities will be undertaken by DRCSC and LRRM as local partners, research consultants and SoH as German re-granting organisation, facilitator and supporter of capacity building workshops in India and knowledge dissemination and advocacy events/workshops in India and Germany. DRCSC will be responsible for the direct implementation of research and interventions in Hingalganj, Sandeshkhali I Block and Kakdwip Block. LRRM will be responsible for direct implementation of research and interventions in Kultali Block. A project Management board fitted with staff members from both organizations will ensure the appliance of equal standards, approaches and Oak Application Form     10methodologies during research and interventions and support cooperation between the organizations.The project shall lay the foundation for a planned follow-up project to strengthen the resilience against climate risks of tribal communities in the Sundarbans and to improve their living conditions. The Objective of the present project (knowledge gained on needs & challenges; development of effective and context specific interventions; establishment of networks and knowledge sharing between local and international practitioners and donors) will serve as a basis for this purpose. The follow-up project shall be timely overlapping with the present project (planned start in 2024/25  depending on the evolvement of the present project) and shall have a budget of between 800,000  1,200,000 EUR. Public and private funding will be secured, inter alia, through networking activities under Outcome 1.7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):What do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here the main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this grant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes describe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some examples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, agency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.Outcome 1: Needs and challenges of tribal communities are identified through an ethnographic research and different Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools. Interventions adapted to the local context and target group (Outcome 2) are assessed and best practices are identified. The knowledge gained on challenges and effective interventions is shared with relevant stakeholders and decision makers.Given the currently scant ethnographic engagement with tribal communities in the SBR, research consultants in cooperation with DRCSC/LRRM will conduct an in-depth ethnographic study to understand the sociocultural context, practices, development needs and aspirations of vulnerable tribal communities, assess their vulnerabilities and climate risks in order to promote awareness of, and protection for, their cultures, customs, rights and interests and to adapt effective interventions for their needs. To avoid further alienating the marginalized communities and to ensure that development initiatives are sustainable in the long term, intervention design must be just, fair, inclusive, locally relevant, and developed and implemented through a people-centred approach. Insights from the ethnographic survey, vulnerability and risk assessment study and relationship-building exercise will enable the project organisers to both assess the needs and aspirations of the communities and facilitate their participation and stewardship in intervention design and activity implementation. Outcome 2: Community-led development interventions aligned to the needs of tribal communities have been designed, piloted, evaluated and improved. Oak Application Form     11Climate risk reduction is increased and the socioeconomic resilience of the target group is strengthened.The planned activities under this Outcome will be based on the findings of the preceding research and assessments (Outcome 1). They are designed participatory together with the target group in a form that indigenous knowledge systems are upheld and combined with scientific methods. The process is community-led, meaning that the collaborating organizations and researchers primary moderate the process, contributing their knowledge and capacities rather than taking the direct lead. The interventions are continuously monitored, evaluated and improved. The interventions focus on group formation and empowerment, climate adaptive and diversified livelihoods, organic agriculture, shore protection and dissemination of critical information to the target group. As the process unfolds over time, the capacities of the community representatives are enhanced to emerge as competent trainers who can achieve self-reliance and continue the community-led work after the completion of the project. Local stewardship will not only enable the project team to successfully overcome the communities hesitation or reluctance in adopting the initiatives but also promote leadership, cohesion and decision-making agency. Outcome 3: Physical and mental health challenges of the tribal communities are addressed. Good health is promoted and access to government health programs is established.The absence of adequate healthcare facilities is accompanied with a lack of awareness of locally prevalent healthcare issues and health-seeking behaviour among the communities. While there is scant literature on the condition of physical and mental health in the SBR, there is an absolute absence of tribal communities in health and well-being-related research, policy and governance in the region. In addition to hypertension, pulmonary and gastrointestinal issues associated with certain environmental hazards like soil and water salinity, mental health disorders like depression, suicide and deliberate self-harm, often linked with experiences of man-animal conflict, frequent disaster-related losses and morbidities, are also widely prevalent. Mental health support is limited to non-existent in the region, with health camps and awareness-building workshops seldom mainstreaming mental healthcare. In the event of the dual crisis of pandemic-induced reverse migration and cyclone-induced rural-urban migration, the lack of infrastructural support and safety nets for migrants and their families became glaringly obvious, and communities relied only on psychosocial support from their friends and relatives.While there is no disaggregated data on the health conditions and needs of tribal communities, the collaborating organizations are aware that inter-generational poverty, neglect and exclusion leads to poor physical and mental health outcomes within these communities. However, knowledge of the specific drivers of poor health and well-being can only emerge from the proposed ethnographic survey. The present objective will synthesize relevant insights from the survey to design interventions to reduce the physical and mental health challenges of the tribal communities and promote good health and overall well-being through the following activities.Oak Application Form     127.c.

Ethnographic survey of 800 tribal households across 8 villages, conducted 3 times (= 2,400 households) during the project period to identify and understand the socio-historical context, tribal practices and the local dynamics of power, gender and exclusion, drivers of vulnerability. The methodology (ethnographic methods, participatory research, semi-structured and unstructured interviews and discussions with community members and other relevant stakeholders, photography and videography, photo voice method) will focus on the lived experiences of the communities and foster meaningful relationships between them and the project team.ii. A Participatory Vulnerability Capacity Assessments (PVCA) to assess the vulnerability and climate risks of the communities based on climate data and accounts of experiencing environmental hazards and climate change impacts and to explore the potential for leadership among the most vulnerable sections of the communities (namely women, youth and marginalized occupational groups) for participation and stewardship in the design and implementation of appropriate interventions to promote inclusive development, resilience und climate risk reduction.iii. Action research comprising monitoring and evaluation at regular intervals to repeatedly assess the efficacy and outcomes of the interventions, and introduce necessary modifications to the intervention strategies and design.iv.

If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):a) Monitoring and evaluation: The key functionaries of each collaborating organization and the researchers will meet on a bi-monthly basis to reflect on learnings from the community processes, and assess the progress of the initiatives vis--vis a calendar of activities jointly developed by them.  The success and failure of different activities and the outcome will be assessed through household surveys repeated annually and issue-based focus group discussions in terms of specific indicators.The assessments under Outcome 1 will examine the degree of vulnerability and the scope of climate risk reduction, and agency, leadership and self-reliance within the vulnerable communities, particularly women and youth. For that matter a performance indicator matrix will be set up and baseline indicators will be assessed.Monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the initiatives will be primarily geared upon a WSHG-led process. The collaborating organizations will evaluate at 2 levels: (1) internal, to continuously examine how effective, people-centric, culturally-sensitive and gender-responsive the decisions, approaches and interventions are throughout the lifecycle of the project. The researchers will conduct yearly and final evaluation surveys, prepare survey reports, and identify avenues/indicators of improvement; and (2) at the community level, where the group leaders shall continually examine the progress of the initiatives over time, in terms of indicators of inclusivity, gender-responsiveness, vulnerability reduction and self-reliance etc.b) Learning: The project seeks to learn about the unique vulnerabilities, needs and aspirations of marginalized tribal groups in the SBR, that are largely invisible in research and unreached in development governance. These ethnographic insights will create a support base for planning, up-Oak Application Form     16scaling and implementation of suitable community-led initiatives in future, to address the needs and reduce the vulnerabilities of this population.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):The projects approach and proposed thrust of interventions i.e., encouraging vulnerable tribal communities in the SBR to articulate their vulnerabilities and unique development needs, and piloting suitable interventions to address these through WSHGs and local youths groups, is likely to pose multiple challenges and risks. Some of these anticipated challenges relate to mobilization of disempowered groups like tribal women and youth amidst their regular duties and struggles, and finding acceptance within the community for the implementation of innovative and modern initiatives which demand significant behaviour change and inform a slow process of transformation. The anticipated risks include potential resistance on the part of powerful vested interests and political lobbies, which poses a threat to community-led work at the frontline. The collaborating organizations can reduce these risks by facilitating regular and transparent communication between the community representatives, state and local governments and the project team. Another challenge would be in promoting sustainable livelihood options among some of the tribes, like the Shabars, who are traditionally hunter-gatherers, predominantly non-agrarian and dependent on forest and ecosystem services. The research team shall address this challenge through knowledge-sharing efforts, learning from indigenous in similar conditions from other parts of the country/ world as well as by negotiating with the Department of Forest for sustainable use of forest resources. Other challenges relate to knowledge gaps about tribal concerns and interests, and gaps in understanding of, and commitment to, an inclusive approach to sustainable development, and probable non-availability of necessary skills and local resources for facilitation at the frontline level. These knowledge gaps and capacity deficits will be addressed through research to gain relevant ethnographic insights and training and information materials for the staff, facilitators, researchers and community representatives, to enhance their understanding and capabilities vis--vis rights-based, gender-responsive, culturally-sensitive and locally-relevant community-led approaches to tribal development.Oak Application Form     17",

Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)Praxis UK was established in 2007 and over fifteen years its focus has expanded to a wide span of issues of social exclusion, participation and governance. Praxis breadth of experience ranges across most sectors of social development in Asia and Africa. Three recent relevant achievements are:1.         Developing community-led ethical review processes to challenge institutional review boards and ensure that for research to be an intervention communities affected by the processes have a say in how the research study, questions and instruments are designed and findings analysed. Supported by Durham University (2020- 2022)2.         Landscape analysis to inform international evaluation in the service of equity to explore the paradigm shift, particularly within global evaluation policies and practices. In collaboration with partners in Latin America, Africa and Asia, the research included exchanges with a range of funding mechanisms to explore how the most excluded and historically oppressed peoples, specifically those in the Global South, play a role in determining the impact and value of any program, policy, or initiative developed in their Oak Application Form     6name and for their development. It helped deconstruct the multiple understandings of equity in evaluation while capturing how some actors in the evaluation ecosystem overcome concrete barriers to achieving equity. Supported by Ford Foundation (2022  2023)3.         Transparency and Accountability Initiative (Track) supported by Laudes Foundation, aims to strengthen existing voluntary and emerging mandatory responsible business regulations in Asia by building enabling ecosystem collaboration with varied stakeholders and making publicly available a set of quality standardised and stakeholder useful information, which can be used by stakeholders to hold businesses to the account.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Sundarbans is an ecologically fragile zone spread across two countries. There is a space for learning from interventions across both. In Phase 1, 114 groups of vulnerable people in five Gram Panchayats of Patharpratima (Digambarpur, Gopalnagar, Herambagopalpur, Achintyanagar and Banashyamnagar), South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, were identified and brought together to diagnose their vulnerabilities, articulate aspirations and avenues of change, and work together. The project covers 20 villages with a population estimate of 1,06,650.After Phase 1, field staff assessed that 29% groups were active and functional  meeting frequently, discussing issues of relevance, taking part in activities, taking ownership of issues and expressing a need for continued engagement. Group members found value in learning new information, finding confidence and exercising collective bargaining power.  They identified issues for action in Phase 2:Effects of climate change (life and livestock threatened by eroding embankments and frequent flooding; livelihoods impacted by increasing soil salinity, limited water resources, poor market linkages);Gender-based discrimination and violence (early marriage; domestic violence; limited opportunities for girls in education /livelihoods; lower wages for women workers; menstrual taboos);Limited access to rights and entitlements (poor healthcare; limited awareness about government schemes);Unsafe migration (dropouts, especially among boys;)Lack of sustainable livelihood options (unsafe migration, dropout)Phase 2 aims to continue the work done while bridging some gaps:Oak Application Form     7Target-driven activity-focus of implementation that overshadowed process-oriented actionsLimited coordination amongst resource agencies affected holistic perspective for staff and communitiesCommunity leadership devoid of perspectives / standsFocus of what should change rested with organisations rather than with communitiesHesitation / reluctance to PRI engagementTo meet these gaps, the consortium framed a theory of change which is presented below:1. How is change within community visualised?After forming their own micro-level plans, the dynamics between community and organisation changed to dependence because of the nature of interventions and expectations of communities. The transformation being visualised in the community isFrom formulating plan to owning the plan by periodic revisiting / evolving their change journey driven by their unique needs (and perspectives)From individual actions / actions that benefit individuals to collective actionsFrom receiving organisations strategies and directions to community-led actions that are more organic, impactful, and sustainable transformationFrom implementing organisations agenda to informing organisations agenda through careful assessment of their strengths, weaknesses, risks and opportunities2. How is change within organization visualised?As community groups assume leadership roles, the organisations role transformsFrom direct control to providing facilitative supportFrom providing trainings to mentoring community resource personsFrom leading networking initiatives to strategic advice on stakeholder engagementFrom a culture of learning (one-way) to a culture of reflection (analytical process)From becoming visible in Patharpratima to networking and collaboration that visibilises ACV beyond Patharpratima3. Is the project truly being able to reach the most marginalised  communities within the village and villages within the block?The consortium must discern whether there are still communities that are sidelined because of identity / the work they do / their inaccessibility / their inability to give time etc. and what further actions are warranted. For this to Oak Application Form     8happen within the people-centred, community-led model, it is important for communities to form their own perspectives around marginalization.Praxis UK sees Phase 2 as an opportunity to showcase ACV as a model of cross-learning and introspection in other geographies, contexts and funding scenarios. ACVs learnings can be offset with similar experiences of community development in Bangladesh and other countries. Praxis UK will reprise the role of facilitating collaborative partnerships to sustain and amplify this model of excellence.",

OBJECTIVESThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain what you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We understand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a multitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define your role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss this with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   7.a. ObjectivesList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals that can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are ambitious but also achievable.  To strengthen people-centred approach in Patharpratima block of Sundarbans whereby vulnerable communities give voice to their aspirations, better understand their vulnerabilities and work towards a collective resolution of challenges they face Achieving highest standards of cooperation among collaborating organizations, leading to deep institutionalization of values of partnership and commitment for community-led approaches to development that are visibilised before other geographies, contexts and donor organisations7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):What do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here the main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this grant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes describe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some examples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, agency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.Oak Application Form     9Outcomes of Objective 1Programme looks at a mix of the following: a) NGOs empower community to collect data on specific issues (a. climate-adaptive livelihood; b. gender-based violence; c. different aspects of child rights; d. climate and environmental impacts such as embankments) and amplifies these; b) NGOs create a platform for communities to present their voice; c) NGOs empower communities to create their own spaces, amplify issues that are important to them through evidence-backed action. By December 2024, at least three community collectives in each hub of Phase 1 will take up and follow through issues of community-led stakeholder engagement / participatory action research, thereby taking small actions towards collective development (some ongoing issues - access to water and strengthening embankments in Achintanagar / Banashamnagar, improving ICDS centre and improving library for children - Digambarpur, access to ambulance - Herambagopalpur, demonstrating models of organic farming and taking actions to sensitise community about child marriage in Gopalnagar). At least five community collectives (model community-led collectives) will follow the trajectory of change from dormant to proactive (existing), from collecting anecdotes / one-time stories to evidence-based analysis, from sharing individual and personal experiences to negotiating solutions; and from having no discussions to having a collective stand on significant issues. By Year 2 and Year 3, ten more such model community collectives will be strengthened. (Total 15) (For example, four surveys covering 500+ respondents have been undertaken by adolescents across all hubs on menstruation-related issues such as taboos / menstrual hygiene; this will be analysed through different lenses and the groups will carry out stakeholder engagement on accessing menstrual hygiene and addressing root cause of taboos - analysis is ongoing) By Year 3, at least 180 community persons (including 30 fellows and at least ten members from each of the above mentioned 15 collectives) will emerge as informed change agents equipped to engage on different issues with different stakeholders - such as PRI members, VLCPC members, village elders, block officials. The themes the collectives work on will be visibilised through events, at different forums and platforms. (Specific focus on use of theatre, folk culture and songs, panchayat-level events and three block-level events will provide ample visibility and space)In newer areas, a similar process will be followed, with a maximum of two collectives per new village.  Outcomes of Objective 2Each collaborating organization has initiated attempts to inform and influence their other programmes and projects with learnings from the people-centred approach of the ACV project. For eg, Mukti's ACV team regularly informs and supports its other projects on approaches learnt through ACV. Rupantaran's team has proposed the use of similar approaches in other blocks of South 24 ParganasIn Phase 2, organisations must find ways of strengthening implementation of their safeguarding policies, which were evolved and Oak Application Form     10framed in Phase 1 with support from Oak.

Several issues have emerged during Phase 1 which require concerted engagement beyond collectives, Oak Application Form     12through nearby Panchayats. (Eg. absence of ambulance in Banshyamnagar-Achintyanagar)Plan includes to continue engagement with former PRI members whom the consortium has engaged with in Phase 1 and seek their support in strengthening work in Phase 2; Plan includes in developing a strategy for involving adolescents through module whereby adolescents can voice their views in Bal Sansad (BTS); engage with PRIs (ISWS, RF); Plan includes identifying and engaging with newer PRI members as they are at a stage of getting to know their communities better through rapport building and exposure visits (Ex. ISWS through exposure visits to Panchayat was able to create a space where adolescents raised a demand for a library that the Panchayat acceded to)    Activities timeline of Objective 2In Phase 1, the consortium has achieved a collaborative and constructive way of working together.1.Strong coordination and collaborationRegular meetings of Steering Committee to be continued for reflection, coordination. Inclusion of at least one community mobilisers from each hub within Steering committee to build second-line leadership. (Monthly, rotating leadership)Form smaller committees to review consortium's towards goals highlighted in theory of change. These will be anchored by field coordinators and project coordinators. (Quarterly, rotating leadership)In Phase 1, resource agencies struggled to provide coordinated support to partners, which resulted in inconsistent pressure on implementing organisations. This will be addressed through bi-monthly meetings of resource organisations and one organisation taking lead. (Bi-monthly, NCAS)Strengthening child safeguarding and PoSH (Praajak)2.Strengthening documentationIn Phase 1, the strength of all partners in documentation has been built. This will be utilised in Phase 2 to document the work of the consortiumCase story analysis by all implementing partners (Dec 2024)Resource agency publicationsComparative review of community development in similar ecologically fragile contexts in other countries such as Bangladesh (Praxis UK, June 2026)3.Donor diversityIndividual partners showcase ACV success to mobilise funds for other projects (Donors like TdH, WHH have expressed interest to bring partners on board for other engagements)Individual partners mobilise funds to support activities in ACV villages (Partners such as BTS, Mukti are drawing support from other projects Oak Application Form     13and RF is approaching donors for support for livelihood activities in hub) Consortium has approached Terre des Hommes to provide non-financial support to ACV: a. Tdh will include adolescent leaders from ACV in their CYP (Children and Young Persons) leadership groups to conduct research on climate change impact on children and lead district and state level stakeholder engagementb. Joint co-creation of strategies to create linkages with DDMA, SDMAc.

        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):In Phase 1, the consortium publicised different aspects of its experiences in a range of forums, regional, national and international. Through Oaks grantee meetings too, the ACV experience has received wide attention and interest with organisations expressing interests in supporting the initiative.Despite this, the consortium in Phase 1 has been guarded about sharing its experiences widely. This is anticipated to change in terms of visibilising the consortiums work. The consortium shall proactively seek spaces where community leaders can present their experiences of being part of collectives. The planned block-level consultations is a step in this direction. The platforms for the same must be identified through a thorough mapping of risks and opportunities.As mentioned in Section 7.1.a and 7.2.b, the consortium members are also identified spaces where they can facilitate networking platforms, as in Gopalnagar Panchayat, through partnerships with organisations such as Terre des Homme and Welthungerhilfe.There is much scope for engagement with PRIs. In Phase 1, some partners actively engaged with PRIs resulting in actions that not only enhanced the confidence of the community, but also created communication channels. This will be taken further in Phase 2.Oak Application Form     14Engagement with media is another area of cooperation which will be targeted in Phase 2. In Phase 1 several articles about activities were published. In Phase 2, the consortium will try to facilitate articles that collective members can directly contribute to.",

Individual actions such as standing up to domestic violence; supporting neighbours / family members in cases of violence2. Formation of models of climate adaptive agriculture in Gopalnagar including crab culture, integrated farming; organic farming.3. Increase in self-confidence fo members, especially women members (women acknowledged that they were being valued as farmers in their own households and decisions around cultivation of the second crop was left to them); women organised a solidarity event in Gopalnagar in 2022 on their own, taking part in rallies, events; adolescents carried out a survey of 500+ respondents on menstruation-related taboos and practices 4. Activities related to embankment protection - In Hermabagopalpur collectives formed groups to monitor the embankments and saplings that had been planted5. In Digambarpur, adolescents negotiated with Panchayat to set up a library for them. Panchayat is carrying out this process     b. The consortium has already started the process of instituting an M&E framework within the consortium. Through the experience anchored by Niti Consulting, the consortium actively participated in developing a theory of change for the Sundarbans. Following this, the consortium engaged in a two-day workshop to evolve its own theory of change. This theory of change will be finalised in December 2023 and followed by entity-level theories of change that each collective can map itself against.Oak Application Form     15The broad trajectory of change as visualised by the workshop is described below, moving from D to A in each category:   1 2 3 4CategoryPROACTIVE GROUPOBSERVATION AND EVIDENCE SKILLSNegotiating ExperiencePerspectiveA Proactive Comparative analysis of evidenceSharing solutions in perspective of other solutionsHas a collective stand on significant issuesB Active Mapping and surveysSharing solutions in demonstrated wayDebates, and arguments, and building consensusC Responds, when soughtCertain case examplesSharing problemsDiscussions happenD Dormant Anecdotes Sharing own individual experienceNo discussions as suchIn Phase 1, consortium evolved indicators to map the success of the programme against.

We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):Through Phase 1, the following risks have been identifiedUncontrollable factors such as the Covid-19 pandemicRepeated incidents of natural disasters (two cyclones in the three-year project cycle)Challenges imposed by adverse local governance systems and individuals within the panchayatOak Application Form     16Pushback by some elements within the community because of gains being made by communityThe first two are risks that the project experienced and found a way of converting into opportunities for building a rapport in the communities they worked in. This built a foundation for the ACV in several locations, visibilising the partners. This also exposed the project in its initial days to unreasonable expectations from the community. These were and will be addressed through a process of sensitisation.Through gradual processes of trainings, partner staff are being oriented on engaging with local administrations such as panchayat, police officers, service providers and others through negotiations and rapport building. As the PRI members in some locations are newly elected, partners can build new relationships through the community members rather than being at the forefront of networking. Also, outgoing PRI members whom the project has built a rapport with can be roped in as community advisors to support the work.",

        "5. ORGANISATION CONTEXT": "6. Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, governance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):SEWA was founded in 1972 by Smt. Ela Bhatt who was honoured with the prestigious National award of Padmashri and Padma Bhushan and gained international acclaim for her work and was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay award. With her guidance, SEWA has been instrumental in spreading across eleven states of India.SEWA Bharat, all India federation of SEWA is headed by Smt. Renana Jhabvala who worked in the initial years in Gujarat. She is the recipient of Padma Shri from Government of India.The Organisation has an executive board which comprises five distinguished women leaders nominated from the different member organizations of the Federation. These members are experienced social workers who have given shape to the organization. Their vast experience in the informal economy and with women workers has contributed to organizing women of the informal sector and expanding the SEWA movement. These leaders have been instrumental in many policy decisions affecting the poor women working in the informal economy, both in their states and at the national level.The SEWA Bharat National Coordinator is appointed by the Board to oversee all the activities within the organisation and coordinate with other SEWA institutions in a manner that the Federation office can pull in resources from other mature SEWAs in addition to the projects that SEWA Bharat implements directly. The National Coordinator is also a bridge between the two National Institutions -SEWA Bharat and SEWA Union to highlight advocacy issues from the ground to the Grant Application Form, July 1 20135National platform.SEWA Bharats broad organisational strategies are made through the Working Committee, which is elected from the Executive Board with the support of the National Coordinator. The National Coordinator is supported by a Central team of sector-specific professionals, Finance & Accounts, HR and Admin teams. Each state also has state coordinators and other programme coordinators and field staff. Where the work covers several districts, the state may have its local admin team. SEWA Bharat has a total staff strength of 300+ Employees and full-time consultants.A Central Team, consolidated  at SEWA Bharat in 2019, whose core mission to focus on organizational development and strategy, along with the respective state CORE teams to work with each other in an integrated approach and create a platform of learning and growth; this enables a streamlined approach to increase productivity and ensure a holistic and integrated approach  towards issues of women workers 6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Financial Overview:SEWA Bharat has committed funding for the organisation for the next three years to the tune of INR 61 Crores. We have committed funding of INR 87lacs - for supporting the project activities in Jharkhand & West Bengal. A dedicated team of professionals under the guidance of the President and National Coordinator through networking, bids and any other source of the proposal, tries to raise funds for the normal and special requirements of the organisation. Many of the programs work closely with the Government where the gaps are filled in through Government support like training space, modules and workshops.SEWA Bharat tries to build up a Core and Reserve fund to mitigate against any future risks and it explained in details in the following section. One of the challenges that we may foresee is exchange rate fluctuations impacting the FCRA funding. The other challenge is the ongoing pandemic situation, where we have planned certain activities which may not happen in the expected scale if the pandemic and lockdown extends beyond an estimated guess. However, SEWA Bharat is trying to mitigate these by bringing Digital knowledge to as many of the grassroots leaders through the support of ongoing and potential funding and building the capacity of grassroots leaders and staff to hold meetings for training, sharing learning and other activities Funding Model:SEWA Bharat has secured funds from various donors like USAID, BMGF, EILEEN FISHER, etc to support our ongoing activities. We have also submitted proposals for fundraising which are currently in pipeline through IDS, Pacesetter, Fidelity, Upwork Foundation, PCI, etc. We are also applying different strategies for fundraising like focusing on individual donors, Exploring online platforms for Grant Application Form, July 1 20136fundraising, like Guidestar, Razorpay,  etc. We are also registered as Guide star; Milaap; Give India; Upwork; WEIGO; Benevity; Keeto, Equality Fund; USAID; JICA Charities Aid foundation. Crowdfunding- we are focusing on our PR and Communications, donations, etc. Reserves and Endowments:Since SEWA Bharat goal is to organize workers to achieve their goals of full employment and self-reliance through the strategy of struggle and development. The struggle is against the many constraints and limitations imposed on them by society and the economy. In order to maintain continuity and to keep our activities ongoing and address challenges from time to time especially at the grassroots level, we have created a CORE and reserve fund, where we receive funds through an overhead contribution from different projects implemented, interest income, membership fees, donations, etc. Since we are expanding at it is becoming difficult to maintain a sufficient level of funds in CORE, we keep on putting our efforts to raise funds from different sources. 6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):1. Establishing SEWA Shakti Kendras (SSKs) as local resource centres have been one of the most successful initiatives so far. Through the SSKs, SEWA acts as an important link with the government for successful outreach of its programs. These SSKs in Bengal have been instrumental in registering 2000 members and spreading awareness around the State Scheme for Unorganised Sector workers introduced in 2018, which led to 5000 more members registering themselves under this scheme.2. Created a network of grassroots leaders called agewans across India in specific geographies. They are the link between people and the government and make efforts to reach information to community members, address community needs as well as ensure linkages with compensatory packages, welfare schemes and developmental programs. They are at the frontline supplementing the government efforts during COVID-19. Agewans have spearheaded the SEWA-led distribution of 50,000+ food and hygiene kits and last-mile delivery in places where the reach of the PDS system has been erratic. The work of Agewans has been recognised and SEWA Bharat has been specially mentioned for its support during COVID-19 by the NITI Aayog.3. Most significant in recent times is SEWA Bharats participation at the UN High-Level Panel [UNHLP] on Womens Economic Empowerment [WEE] and subsequent conversations in India to contextualise the UNHLP recommendations for India. During this period, SEWA Bharat hosted a discussion with Phumzile Mlambo-ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women at its headquarters in Delhi and is right now contributing towards the development of a national roadmap on WEE in India. Grant Application Form, July 1 201376d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):A detailed note on the strategic plan for the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand addressing key questions is also attached (Annexure 1)6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):As of 2018, both the states feature very low on the Human Development Index [HDI] (0.641 and 0.599[1]), and their HDI score is below the national average (0.647). With 19.98% and 36.96%[2] of the population of West Bengal and Jharkhand living in poverty and 71.16% and 56.21%[3] female literacy rates, the problems of poverty, the gender divide in educational attainment, income and access to resources is widespread. Women are often the primary breadwinners and caregivers of a household in these states as men tend to migrate out for better work opportunities, yet, women remain at the fringes of work and income, eking out a livelihood under extremely exploitative conditions. This gets reflected in the falling Female Labor Force Participation Rate [FLPR] in both states. The female labour force participation in West Bengal has increased from 18.08 in 2011 to 23.3 in 2018, the same has reduced from 29.10 in 2011 to 18.08 in 2018 in Jharkhand[4]. If we see in terms of trades, research shows that most agricultural workers are women in these states, but their landholding is minimal and productivity has been constantly decreasing due to climate change, migration of males and limited access to government benefits. Beedi workers are struggling to continue with their livelihood and domestic workers are denied leaves and fair wages. SEWA has done an exploratory study in Jharkhand, (SEWA Exploratory Study Jharkhand, 2016) which shows that 63% of women have no awareness of the welfare boards and very few workers have identity cards. We have seen that women take up seasonal work and remain unemployed for a large part of the year. They rely on contractors and middlemen to broker their salary and conditions and often entangle themselves in large amounts of debt. Not being able to go up the supply chain, upskill themselves or gain income mobility are predominant issues as well. Their working conditions are equally precarious owing to their lack of bargaining power. Early pregnancy[5] is reportedly common, women and girls face restrictions on their mobility and traditional caregiving roles are encouraged for women while taking up non-traditional work is frowned upon.In the past 3 years in Jharkhand and 16 years in West Bengal, SEWA has unionised and collectivised more than 20,000 women in the informal economy. SEWA has worked towards increasing collective bargaining strength, empowering communities to access information and entitlements through SSKs, enhancing skill and creating opportunities for access to markets. The effort is being led by a cadre of 129 agewans (grassroots leaders). Following are the preliminary findings from the end-project impact assessment (phone-based) study conducted in both states in July-August 2020.[6]A majority of the respondents, that is 65.60%, women attend unit meetings organised by SEWA at least once a month. While the remaining members attend meetings once in two or three months.Grant Application Form, July 1 2013850% of all members have received at least one type of training offered by SEWA in the last 2 years.Among all trades/work, a majority of domestic workers (57%) and beedi workers (51%) are aware of at least one form of entitlement/govt. or employer benefit that they are eligible for (minimum wages[44%], weekly offs [31%], provident fund [24%], Occupational Health Safety compensation [29%], Tool and Safety Kit Support Scheme (25%), Use of traditional seeds (13.6%) and Organic fertilizers(10.6%)66.3% SEWA members have indicated that they received information about trade-specific entitlements and benefits from SEWA compared to other sources of information.22% of SEWA members have ever used the SEWA Shakti Kendras premises  to apply for a scheme or to apply for a government identification or avail a government benefitGoing forward, we would strengthen the existing cadre of agewans so they can lead community efforts and SSKs and create new agewans and SSKs. We would also address womens trade-specific needs, explore alternate livelihoods so women can diversify or pivot their income sources and simultaneously, look to build our grassroots advocacy. The next generation of young leaders will also be created to ensure continuity of the movement and relationships with the local administration and government officials will be nurtured to ensure strong private-public partnership. The above feeds into SEWA Bharats commitment to ensuring full employment and self-reliance for women in the informal economy. SEWA Bharat has been building the capacity of its member organisations and advancing the rights of women workers through its twin goals of organising and struggle. We have different streams of work focused on unionising women; advancing gender equality and rights; trying out innovative and different models of organising women such as union, federation, cooperatives, collective social enterprises, producer companies; and fostering womens economic empowerment by increasing womens access to market and finance.Though the registration process for a state union has been facing bureaucratic barriers in Bengal, SEWA members continue their alliance with the National Union and would continue holding trade group meetings as is done within a formal union structure in the state.

Objective 1 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):A cadre of 205 grassroots leaders/agewans will be built in the next 3 years with leadership, negotiation and decision-making skills to lead the community advocacy efforts14 Yuva Mandals of 15 girls each will be created to foster youth leaders and champions at the grassroots level in the next 3 yearsA total of 41,000 members will be strengthened across the two states over the next 3 yearsGrant Application Form, July 1 201310contribute to and participate in village council meetings. SEWA will handhold agewans during the 3 years and track progress post-training.3.Developing youth leaders and champions and strengthening the existing champions: SEWA has created 10 Yuva Mandals reaching out to 140 girls in West Bengal in the past 3 years. SEWA will make efforts to sustain the existing 10 Yuva Mandals in West Bengal and the 4  new Yuva Mandals in Jharkhand while seeking to initiate a few new Yuva Mandals in Jharkhand. These youth groups will be trained in two thematic streams: basic aspects of gender equality being one which will include good touch and bad touch, life skills, sexual and reproductive health, problems related to early marriage; social issues and technical skills including digital literacy, research methods and data collection techniques. Emphasis will be laid on the importance of safe migration and self-defence to prepare girls for their life going forward. We will work with Integrated Child Development Services [ICDS] to link with government schemes, with counselling and health services meant for adolescent girls. These youth leaders and champions will play a key role in taking this movement forward.4.Organizing exposure visits: SEWAs training model integrates classroom training with practical training that includes regular interaction with stakeholders and exposure visits. To this end, exposure visits are aimed to engender cross-learning and information sharing, building a broader and pragmatic understanding of ground-level situations and understanding the different models/pathways of work in other states and organisations along with developing empathy and compassion among the grassroots leaders, youth groups and SEWA team members. In the past, SEWA has conducted exposure visits to different other SEWA states, for example, women of West Bengal visited Jharkhand earlier to meet SEWA Jharkhand members. This helped them to see the replicability of learnings and adapt the learning from the other states. In a similar manner, exposure visits will be organized to other SEWA states to facilitate an understanding of the nuances around SEWAs unionisation and movement building work over the years.5.Capacity building sessions of state teams to SEWA ethos and objectives of the program: SEWA Bharat has worked with a dynamic project team in the past years and will continue to build their capacities so they can effectively implement this project as well. To this end, SEWA will carry out refresher training for team members on SEWA ethos, on SEWA union and its years of struggle and movement building work. Additionally, team members will receive training in gender equality and decent work for women, how to take collective action, and how to challenge patriarchy. SEWA will develop the teams understanding of the objectives of this program. Though the project has been developed in consultation with grassroots teams, orientation and onboarding exercise will revitalise the team spirit, triggering cross-learning and information exchange.6.Organising campaigns for community awareness generation: In the past years, campaigns have played a crucial role in inspiring attitudinal change in West Bengal and Jharkhand. Therefore, SEWA will organise campaigns on a rolling basis to circulate key messages on welfare schemes, life skills, health and on prevention of violence against women in the world of work. Information on new opportunities will be circulated. Examples of role models will be shared through these campaigns and linkages will be ensured.Grant Application Form, July 1 2013117.2.a.

Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1.Strengthening the existing SEWA Shakti Kendras [SSK] and creating new SSKs: SEWA has set up 6 SEWA Shakti Kendras (SSKs) as local resource centres in West Bengal and Jharkhand. The SSK is a place where people meet and share their common concerns and have dialogues to address larger issues faced by them, at the same time obtain up-to-date information on all programmes and schemes. It connects community members with government schemes and services. Our efforts are to make it a community-owned, community-managed centre under the leadership of women and young people. Based on the needs assessment done this year, SEWA will aim to set up 8 new SSKs and strengthen the 6 existing SSKs with infrastructure and digital tools across the two states in the course of 3 years. (Refer to Annexure 2 for the model)2.Training cum orientation of SSK centre-in-charges: A total of 14 SSK in-charges will be trained in two-phased training with a focus on digital literacy and use of digital devices and software. Government linkages and trade memberships, linking with social security, how to operate an online application platform, and a broader understanding of advocacy and government interactions etc. will be a part of the training.3.Procurement of new software and hand holding on how to use the software: A software will be procured and will be tailored to the needs of the SSKs. This will be installed in the desktops/laptops and tablets at the SSKs. The software will help generate dashboard, maintain database and record of members among other things.4.Delivery of services by the SSK: SSKs will carry out linkages with government schemes and services. A digital database on relevant schemes will be provided to the SSKs by the national SEWA Bharat team to help SSKs carry out the linkages. The SSK will also respond to the health 7.2.b. Objective 2 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Over the next 3 years, 100% linkages with state-specific schemes such as Samajik Suraksha Yojna;all-India schemes such as MGNREGA, ration card, JSY and health schemes will be ensuredIn the next 3 years, registration of workers under the sector-specific schemes and boards will be ensuredSSKs will reach out to over 50,000 community members for social security outreach.Grant Application Form, July 1 201312concerns affecting women and girls. It will also address issues of violence in the world of work. SSK will act as the site for training and learning at the unit level.5.Providing handholding support and overall tracking: SEWA Bharat will provide handholding support to all stakeholders and will track their work throughout the course of three years. MIS systems will help record and track information on members and help generate reports. All data will be entered into the digital MIS systems. SEWA will continue with its holistic approach of hand-holding beyond the training period through post-training agewan engagement activities and meetings and will prepare the agewans for community engagement, government liaisoning and grassroots advocacy.7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):To collectivise women workers [beedi workers, domestic workers, construction workers, street vendors, agri-workers] to enable them to better engage with stakeholders in the value chain for full employment and have better access to markets and resources7.3.c. Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1.Strengthening the trade groups: In the past years, SEWA has organised and unionised women into separate trade groups at the community level. So far, West Bengal has 1 domestic worker group and 3 beedi workers groups while Jharkhand has 1 construction worker group, 15 domestic workers groups, 9 construction worker groups, 22 agricultural worker groups. These have been formed for women to share and discuss their concerns within these groups. In the next few years, SEWA will strengthen these groups further with the leadership of the agewans. Strengthening a group will require training and handholding agewans and linkage building. The trade groups will address the sector-specific needs.2.Strengthening trade committees: SEWA has set up trade committees 7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):30% of the women domestic workers trained will have increased wages and weekly offs10,000 beedi workers will have access to PF benefit30% trained in tailoring and stitching will have increased income10% agri-workers will have increased productivity200 women/girls will be linked with alternate livelihoodGrant Application Form, July 1 201313(representation from all sectors, unlike Trade group which is sector-specific) in the two states. In West Bengal, trade committees will decide the work and strategy for the whole year for the different trade groups and will carry out the advocacy agenda on specific issues along with sector-specific workers and local and state-level authorities. They will feed into the advocacy of SEWA national council meetings and unions. The trade committees will look to increase the membership base within the trade groups to bring more workers under this solidarity building movement. Trade committee meetings will take place once a year.3.Promoting evidence-based advocacy through multi-stakeholder platforms and meetings: Past learnings have shown that multi-stakeholder meetings are a great way to advocate and increase the visibility of SEWAs work. SEWA will create a platform for members so they can articulate their needs in front of the inter-sectoral agencies, including government officials, private sector players and other CSOs etc. Block, district level and state level meetings in both states will be conducted in year 2 and 3. The main purpose of these meetings will be to highlight challenges in front of government officials and figure out synergies to enable the creation of shared agendas that can help take common initiatives forward in a collaborative partnership with multiple agencies. The evidence generated at the unit meetings, trade group meetings and the MIS will feed into the advocacy event. The key emerging advocacy issues have been around wages, working conditions, provident fund, workers recognition, income and market access so far. Alongside this, separate trade-specific campaigns will help highlight and collectively bargain for the needs.4.Exploring and linking with alternate livelihoods: Due to COVID, SEWAs stream of workaround exploring and linking with alternate livelihoods has become strong. To that end, an orientation program on alternative livelihoods will be organised in partnership with National Rural Livelihoods Mission [NRLM] district representatives at the block level in both the states. Simultaneously, the sectors of agriculture and animal husbandry will be explored in Jharkhand with local authorities and NGOs. In West Bengal, through the existing 2 centres, we will continue to offer a 6-monthly training on sewing-tailoring for young girls. SEWA in Malda will tie-up with the government training programs for preliminary and advanced training in sewing and tailoring. We will also explore other hyper-local needs so the children of beedi workers can take up other trades as beedi work has emerged to be unsustainable due to anti-beedi campaigns.",

(600 words):Sundarbans is a part of the tidally active delta where the land building process is still incomplete with Ganges-Brahmaputra River system carries suspended sediment load through numerous interlacing channels, intervening islands with the elevation of less than 3 meters above msl. Agriculture forms the backbone of the economy of Sundarban, where the entire area is dependent on a single crop, the rain-fed (mostly high yielding varieties) paddy. Sundarbans, is threatened by various biophysical and social barriers, emerges as a unique case where the most vulnerable population lives in an extremely vulnerable situation with high risk of hazards which is characterized by a low level of development and lack of infrastructure, prevalence of extreme poverty and lack of health facilities. It is also under the threat of severe coastal erosion due to relative sea level rise, increase in surface air temperatures and increased intensity of cyclone. All these results into the following negative impacting factor for livelihood systems of Sundarbans - a) increased anthropogenic pressure for livelihood on natural resources b) increased seasonal and permanent outmigration c) lack of stability in livelihood operations d) landlessness and poor resource profile triggered by land loss/degradation and debt trap.Oak Application Form     7There is a pressing need of a strategy to create examples of sustainable livelihood options which can transform the local economy. Such transformational strategy needs to be built on:Value chain-based approach where various business opportunities (including products and services) can be created along the value chain with backward and forward linkages.  This aims to boost up the entire economy around a product line.Cluster based approach where value chain actors come together in homogeneous or heterogeneous groups depending on the product and associated services. This will create scope of inclusion of members who do not possess resources/means of primary production.Inclusion of vulnerable communities like traffic survivors, landless, forest dependents etc. with special focus on youth and women. Gradual shifting from livelihood approach to microenterprises.  Organizing farmers into Farmer Producer Companies for achieve economies of scale and long-term sustainability.Networking with knowledge and financial institute/agencies to leverage funding/technical support. Already established Green College can be a strategic institute to support training and capacity building.Developing a team with local CSO partners who can own and continue the initiative.The approach is developed on the basis of a) Welthungehilfes experience of last two decades in the region where we have been active with the transformative approaches of multisectoral approach to nutrition, rural skill building through green colleges, microplanning involving local community to support government planning program of GPDP and ecological agriculture b) Scoping study commissioned by Oak Foundation c) FGD with CSOs of Sundarbans.",

A ToT before the identification and a consolidation workshop to analyze the result of the identification exercise are planned to take decision of trades.A1.2Develop comprehensive and tailored training curriculum for community members, which covers technical skills, business development, and marketing skills needed to strengthen the identified value chains.This will be supported by the existing curriculum framework of Welthungerhilfe but will be adopted through writeshops with local trainers/entrepreneurs. Writeshops are manual development workshops where content writer, content expert, artist and designers work together. 5 trades will be picked up from the Trade Identification exercise (A1.1). While developing/adopting the content, climate friendly, green, fair and ethical trades/technologies will be given preference.A1.3Conduct training courses and mentor high-potential trainees on each value chain, to build their skills and confidence in managing their own businesses as well as create job opportunities.The enterprise facilitator team will identify potential trainees from their respective location in a geographical cluster on the basis of set criteria and send them to Green College. Depending on the content, the trainees will go through training of short term (7 Days), Mid Term (15~30 Days) or Long Term (60 Days) courses. The days will be divided equally into residential sessions and self-practice sessions. The training method will be a mix of theoretical (10~20%), practical (50~60%) Business development skill building (15%) and soft skill building (15%). After the training, the enterprise facilitator will follow up and mentor the trainee for a duration of 3~6 months, depending on the need of the trainees. 1000 trainees will be trained in batches of 20~25.120 High Potential Rural Youth (HPRY) trainees selected from these 1000, will be taken through Fast Track programme of accelerated learning with ideation Oak Application Form     10phase, innovation camp, communication workshop and network meet.

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Acquired credibility as an organisation that specialises in training to ensure empowerment and safety of women at all levels over 20 years Contributed in Information Service through development of Resource Directories for Women in Crisis Situation, supported and replicated by UN Women in 11 other states of IndiaResearch and Training on Sexual Harassment at Workplace of Transpersons and Lesbian WomenThe Politics of Silence, one of the earliest researches in India by Sanhita in 2001, broke silence around the issue of denial and brought voices of aggrieved women to the centre stageAward: Sanhita received Rushi B. Gimi Award in 2004 instituted by Governor of West Bengal for contribution to womens empowerment and social work.The following have been achieved through the past 6 years of partnership with Oak Foundation:Dialogue with the Department of Women and Child & Social Welfare (WCD) and West Bengal Commission for Women resulting in their issuing directives for implementation of the SHWW Act, 2013 and constitution of Local Committees across all districts. The present status as informed by the Dept. of WCD is that, all District Officers submit annual reports to the department as mandated in the SHWW Act, 2013.Two state level Orientation Programmes were conducted for the District Social Welfare Officers (DSWOs), Ex Officio of the Local Committee, to strengthen the function of these Committees, in 2015 and 2016 respectively. 15 (out of 20) DSWOs were trained through these Orientation Programmes.However, there is a need in future for a Situation Analysis Research to understand the knowledge, skill and effectiveness of prevention and redress of sexual harassment in the districts, for planning Sanhitas future intervention.Sanhita provides handholding support to deal with SHW complaints lodged in North 24 Parganas Local Committee in the capacity of the Chair of the Committee.Sanhita in response to the request of the DSWOs, has written and produced SHW Primer under Oak Support which is to be disseminated to District Officers, DSWOs and monitoring authorities along with employers and SHW Committees for proper implementation of the SHWW Act, 2013.Dialogue with the Department of Health & Family Welfare and capacity building of the key officials in the districts resulted in the decentralised constitution of Internal Committees at CMOH Chief Medical Officer of Health) offices across all districts of West Bengal. This was followed by training of Internal Committees in five Medical Colleges & Hospitals in Kolkata.Sanhita also provides handholding support to deal with SHW complaints in the Internal Committee of Health Department (Headquarter) and Medical Colleges & Hospitals in Kolkata in the capacity of External Member.A Situation Analysis Research is needed to know about the present status and Grant Application Form, July 1 20138functioning in the district committees.Promoted responsibility of employers for women workers from resource poor backgrounds though issue-based partnership with key Government Departments such as Department of Health, WCD, Panchayat & Rural Development employing large number of women workers.Engagement with the Directorate of ICDS resulting in the decentralised constitution of Internal Committees in select districts of West Bengal.Enrolled as a Technical and Training Organisation by Administrative Training Institute (ATI), GoWB and engaged in institutional capacity building of a range of stakeholders.14 Grassroot leaders were trained on the SHW issue and the SHWW Act. The Grassroot Leaders in turn, have raised awareness of over 1000 women workers; primarily construction, domestic and factory workers through 210 community meetings conducted over a year in 7 clusters spread across 3 blocks of Ranchi District. In all areas ICDS and health workers were involved in the community meetings.The women workers have successfully secured some basic entitlements like toilets and place to rest thereby improving the safety at their work spaces. 28 dynamic, vocal and articulate women leaders participated in a day long camp which has further enhanced their awareness on the issue.In the absence of Local Committees, pre-existing community level institutions (forums and committees) were identified and strengthened to take up cases of sexual harassment/violence against women. At least 30 cases/incidents of SHW have been shared by women workers. Some of these have been taken up for redress with the community level institutions.Conducted an Orientation Programme for Government Officials and NGO representatives from Eastern & North Eastern States in 2017. Subsequently, Sanhita was invited by both the government and NGO Networks from the states like Bihar, Orissa and Meghalaya to design and facilitate further training. Its worth mentioning that Sanhita designed and facilitated the first series of Orientation Programmes for state officials and SHW Committee members for the Government of Meghalaya in 2019.The SHW Primer produced under the Oak Foundation support will be shared with the Govt. of Meghalaya.  Created evidence-based knowledge through field research on SHW from the select institutions and through several multi-lingual IEC materials for a wide range of stakeholders.Strengthened the crisis intervention as external member and advisor of SHW Committees across sectors like PSU, NGOs, Private Organisations, Factories and Hospitals.Sanhita received nearly 100 calls from individuals as well as ICs through the dedicated helpline seeking assistance for SHW redress which has been provided. Based on two rounds of Case Analysis conducted by Sanhita, we observed that the number of complaints reaching out to Sanhita has gradually increased over the years.Award: Founding Director of Sanhita has been felicitated by GoWB for contribution to the SHW issue in 2016. The following achievements of Sanhitas work on the issue of SHW since Grant Application Form, July 1 201392015 under the Oak Foundation Support are recognised in the External Evaluation (conducted in 2021):  Ground Breaking Work:Sanhitas work on sexual harassment at workplace has been ground breaking in the context of West Bengal, their engagement spans across government departments, civil society organisations, law networks and grassroots outreach.Sanhita has established and maintained several partnerships that has helped them grow and expand the work they are doing and the support they are providing spanning from training, IEC materials to research & crisis support.Responses from the Government Stakeholders:Across government stakeholders there is an agreement, that Sanhita was the correct organisation to engage as they were experts in the field of sexual harassment law, specifically the organisations expertise, dedication and long history of working in the field.Sanhita is thus perceived and recognised as being experts in the field by various government departments.The networking efforts have allowed Sanhita to be deeply embedded, that is they are recognised and have established relationships and connections within government systems as the go-to organisation where sexual harassment is concerned.Resourceful IEC and Training Modules:Sanhita has been successful in creating IEC materials whose uptake by government departments is a significant achievement.Across SHW Committee members interviewed there was a great appreciation of Sanhitas IEC materials which have been greatly beneficial to the organisations and have been used for multiple purposes and at multiple levels.The adaptability of their training modules and their ability to engage effectively with a section that is largely left out is commendable.Responses from the SHW Committees and Institutional Associations:Across SHW Committees there is a strong recognition of the support they have received from Sanhita. Especially the fact that Sanhita has been proactive, sensitive and practical in their dealing of complaints.SHW Committee members have also spoken of the times when Sanhita has gone above the call of duty and supported them through very difficult and trying times and how their support gave the Committee courage to fight difficult battles especially against those in power.Sanhita was ascribed to be extremely proactive and consistent in their efforts, by the Institutional Associations. Grant Application Form, July 1 2013106d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Sanhita is a Gender Resource Centre established with the vision of gender justice and gender equity.  Sanhita was founded in the year 1996 to mainstream gender concerns by enabling institutional accountability and systemic changes.The current strategy of Sanhita for the period from 2021  2026 is based on the above and has emerged from its past experiences and learning as well as the recommendations of the External Evaluation conducted in 2021:Promoting institutional responsibility for safe workplaces for institutionally employed women workers particularly those from resource poor backgrounds through:Institutional capacity building and Developing prevention and redressal mechanisms of varied stakeholders (like relevant government departments, monitoring & regulatory bodies, district administration, employers, institutional associations among others)Developing issue based strategic partnerships with working groups, confederations and networks of employers and institutional associations among othersStrengthening redress of SHW byCapacity Building of Complaints Committees through training and counselling services,Intervention & support to women workers and Committees through helpline, Engagement with Committees as external members and advisors to monitoring bodies and different organisations Capacity Building of External MembersDeveloping understanding of the field realities & the implementation status of the Act that would shape future work of Sanhita and Continued Knowledge Creation on the issue of SHW for the various stakeholders across sectors through Constant review and analysisEvidence based field researchDevelopment of IEC and training materials in local languagesPromotion of access of women workers to useful information Review of SHW complaintsThe Recommendations of External Evaluation (conducted in 2021) of Sanhitas work on the issue of SHW since 2015 under the Oak Foundation Support:Sanhita needs to percolate down to the grassroots level to include more marginal and vulnerable women -This is being planned & done presently under the PHF funded project where the Anganwadi Workers and leaders of the SHG federations are being reached out to through engagement with the relevant departments. Need to work on Data Management of cases wherein data is made available to Sanhita, through its engagements, be collected and Grant Application Form, July 1 201311managed in a systematic manner to enable further research -Periodic analysis of SHW complaints sourced from State Womens Commission as well those complaints where Sanhita was engaged either as an external member or in an advisory role is part of Sanhitas ongoing & regular work. We plan to share the findings with the monitoring bodies for them to take necessary steps for improving the redress mechanisms. Sensitisation of top-level Management in Private Sector Industries Sanhita has already initiated the work through strategic partnership with CII. We plan to extend this work to other confederations of industries and employers associations under this proposal.   Additional Training for ICs This is being addressed under the PHF funded project where in a detailed Situational Analysis of the current status of ICs is being undertaken. Based on the findings of the Situational Analysis, need based training will be organised to enhance the knowledge and skill of ICs for better and effective case redress. Sensitisation of Men should be made a priority Sensitisation of men is already being partially integrated in our work. We consciously engage with men as part of our orientation with the HR from industries and PSUs, representatives of workplace associations and various profiles across government departments. Broadening understanding of Third Party Harassment Sanhita plans to focus more on this through its Training and Orientation Programmes and IEC Materials.  Need for an in-depth study to understand the needs of women in the unorganised sector for greater accountability This will be part of our long-term strategy and will be undertaken in collaboration with relevant institutions working with unorganised women.6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):The premise of the project is to work on the issue of creating safe workplaces for women.Sexual harassment is a manifestation of sex discrimination and violence against women at the workplace that thrives in an atmosphere of threat, terror and reprisal. Sexual harassment at workplace adversely affects the safety, dignity, mental and physical well-being of women resulting in loss of life, job and livelihood opportunities Grant Application Form, July 1 201312among others. It is a manifestation of power relations as women are much more likely to be victims of sexual harassment because of their status at work, vulnerability, insecurity, and social conditioning.Challenges24 years post the Vishaka Judgement and 8 years post the enactment of the SHWW Act, implementation of the Act in the true spirit is yet to happen. There is however, no comprehensive data on the complaints of SHW is available. Based on Sanhitas experience, the number of recent court judgments and the narratives available post the #MeToo Movement it emerges that many workplaces still believe that SHW is a rare or trivial issue and that the women are responsible for their harassments.  Evidence shows that the complaints are not dealt with sensitively.  When the woman attempts to speak out the pattern is to subvert her credibility to prove that the complaint is motivated, if not false. Lack of employer accountability towards effective prevention and redress of SHW and the gaps in the Act to define the role of monitoring and regulatory bodies, have created several loopholes and cracks in the redress process.Due to the absence or limited access to redress mechanisms, the women workers from resource poor backgrounds and the precariously positioned ones among the institutionally employed remain particularly vulnerable. The SHWW Act 2013 is geared towards safety of women workforce and as such may be read as gender specific, applicable to only cisgender women. However, in a changing world order where notions around gender identity and expression are important markers of personhood, the Act might have to be extended in order to make it inclusive of transgender persons. OpportunitiesThe legal framework for employer responsibility towards safe working environment is enshrined in the Constitution of India which provides the basic opportunity for working on the SHW issue.The landmark Vishaka Guidelines and the SHWW Act provide a comprehensive definition of SHW and include all kinds of women at workplaces under its ambit. The Act places the onus for safe workplaces on the employer and provides the aggrieved woman recourse to civil proceeding alongside existing criminal proceeding.The scope for addressing and working on the SHW issue expanded manifold when the issue took centre stage in 2018 because of the # Me too movement and brought renewed focus to the prevalent cultures within organizations that perpetuate SHW and victimize women.With regard to the issue of SHW, the legal landscape in India has been a constantly evolving one and has led to progressive judgements of Honble Supreme Court and High Court leading to organisations across sectors reviewing their compliance to the Act. The scope for work increased by inclusion of SHW in the various service rules and in the Section 29 (d) of Code on Wages, 2019 and Section 134 of Companies Act, 2013 which mandated compliances through service rules among others.",

Summarise the projects ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):Grant Application Form, July 1 20134( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)The largest cohort of employees, tea garden workers, in West Bengal continues to be deprived of the most basic rights of water, sanitation, electricity, and housing amongst others. While the government has introduced flagship welfare schemes through the tea board and introduced bills such as Plantation Labor Act (1951), poor implementation hasnt improved conditions. In this context, Swaniti aims to work closely with the network of civil society organizations, district administration, and state government to operationalize core welfare programs for tea garden workers. For example, all tea garden workers should have access to adequate housing. However, most local administration does not adhere to even the basic standards of housing. Lack of governance overview has led to the deprivation of this key group. In this context, Swaniti and it's partners proposes to embed teams into each affected district and state government to work with the local ecosystem and ensure the delivery of programs. The team will be expected to come up with joint solutions and implement them with the support of the local administration. By the end of the program, tea garden workers will be expected to have access to public programs.",

        "5. ORGANISATION CONTEXT": "6. Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, governance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Swaniti was founded in 2012 with the goal of strengthening governance tools. We believe that if public services are accessible and inclusive to the most vulnerable then they will have an opportunity to grow and thrive with equal opportunity. With this in mind, Bhattacharya founded Swaniti by supporting Parliamentarians and district administration through key knowledge insights. Bhattacharya drew from her experience of interning at Senators offices. She eventually received a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School and joined the World Bank. The founding of Swaniti has been an accumulation of her experiences in working in the governance space. Today, the Swaniti board consists of similarly passionate individuals including Richard Rossow (India Chair at Center for Strategic and International Studies), Elizabeth Gamino (development professional and advocate on equal rights), and Shantanu Agarwal (Venture Capitalist working on climate and sustainability technologies). Subsequently, Swanitis senior leadership also brings in similar experiences and commitment to government. Our leadership has significant experience in public service with tremendous insights Grant Application Form, July 1 20135into challenges on the ground. For example, our COO comes with experience from NITI Ayog where he was part of the evaluations team. Similarly, our program leads bring in the experiences from institutions such as the Ministry of Planning (central government), the Department of industries (Andhra government) and the Monitoring Project Management Unit (Ranchi district). Given that Swaniti aims to improve local governance in public service delivery, we maintain a decentralized model of placing team members within the community to better understand and deliver on programs. Team members placed with state governments come from grassroots background but are expected to maintain strong communication skills. For example, we have onboarded Aspirational District Fellows who have demonstrated strong verbal and written skills through the recruitment process. These team members come in with 5-7 years of work experience and advanced degrees. We have found such professionals to bring in the emotional intelligence to manage community based roles. All team members are expected to connect with community members, civil society partners, and government stakeholders to ensure that they have the whole picture and their contribution. Swaniti combines a top-down and bottom-up approach: our senior leadership connects with all mid-level and junior associates on a bi-monthly basis to get their insight on projects and their experiences. Based on this feedback we design or iterate projects. This is coupled with our impact evaluation and talent management team also connecting with them.For this project, Swaniti plans on leveraging our previous experiences to ensure strong team design and program implementation.6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Swaniti is a non-profit entity with seventy percent of its funding coming from foundations such as Climateworks, McArthur, and Ford Foundation. And the remaining thirty percent is through government partnerships. When working with Foundations, Swaniti works in a tri-partite model where we provide technical assistance to state governments with their cooperation while we are being funded by a foundation partner to accomplish specific outcomes. Our annual operating budget for 2021-22 is at 3.5 million USD as we continue to expand our work across states and districts. Our biggest partners include UNICEF, SED Fund, and Laudes Foundation. With the exception of the upcoming grant from National Democratic Institute, all our grants our focused on work within India. Swanitis fundraising strategy is to focus on multi-year state programs where we hope to focus on two areas of development: a.) economic response to climate change and b.) social protection for vulnerable populations across India. Using our corpus which is support by Skoll Foundation, Swaniti is continuing its work with legislators and policymakers. In the upcoming years, Swaniti is currently in conversation with Bloomberg Philanthropies and Childrens Investment Fund for projects in India and Bangladesh.Swaniti recognizes that as we scale up, it is important to have in place partners who can support us in our work in India. In order to strengthen Swaniti systems further, we plan on partnering with reputed organizations who can continue to be key partners on programs. These partners would be FCRA-compliant and include Grant Application Form, July 1 20136the likes of Digital Empowerment Foundation and UN Women. Swaniti expects these agencies to not just be alligned programmatically but also have regional presence in states where it is working, including in West Bengal. Through programs such as the proposed project of the Oak Foundation, we hope to uncover organizations who have alignment with Swaniti's mission, to ensure that programs are codesigned and executed smoothly. We believe that this would allow for our overall systems and programs to be strengthened. Thus we are particularly excited about the Oak proposal since it is providing us the opportunity to build on the above mentioned model. As we continue to scale Swaniti's growth, we hope to be able to establish strong partners and work in India. 6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Swaniti Initiative aims to deliver public services to the poorest of the poor by strengthening governance. Swaniti is a 501(c)3 with a team size of over 100+ professionals. In the past, we have worked in states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. In the process, we have been able to establish direct advisory support to Chief Ministers offices in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, and Meghalaya. Swaniti team constantly monitors our policy impact on the ground. We do so by developing detailed logframes with output, outcomes and impact indicators to tangibly measure the impact of our work. We have seen that our interventions have established inclusive systems and processes for the most most vulnerable in government policies. In Andhra Pradesh, for example, Swaniti Initiative has been able to significantly improve last mile delivery of MGNREGS by reducing payment errors by approximately 90%. In Jharkhand, the team has been able to mobilise public finances to enable the transition towards a green ecosystem in the state by untapping high amounts of public finance. Interventions undertaken include installation of solar rooftops in government buildings, provision of EV vehicles to ANM workers for effective last mile delivery of healthcare, employment generation and increased incomes through solar pumps etc. These are just some of the systemic and process changes that have worked on. To accomplish the goal mentioned above, Swaniti has had the opportunity to partner with established institutions like World Economic Forum, Harvard University, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Through our ten-year experience, we have been able to mobilize over 5 million dollars of untapped funding and impacted over 300,000 lives. We have been acknowledged for our exceptional work by publications like Forbes (30 under 30 lists for work with Swaniti), Fortune (40 under 40 lists), World Economic Forum (as Young Global Leader), Special Invitee to the White House, and Australia  India Youth Dialogue Young Leader.Swanitis work has been featured in national and international publications including Indian Express, Times of India, Hindustan Times, Reuters, and NPR.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Grant Application Form, July 1 20137Key to Swanitis strategy in the next five years is to work in a collaborative model. Specifically, Swaniti plans on building on its current cross-sectoral model of working with multiple stakeholders to ensure policy and implementation change in governance. Swaniti sees the role of the government as being catalytic in serving the community. However, to be sustainable and scalable, programs need to engage with communities and bring together local partners for successful execution. Accordingly, Swaniti pursues a triangular model of collaboration in overall service delivery. The three key stakeholders who maintain a symbiotic relationship are as follows:   The community is our primary stakeholder. To make a program sustainable it is important to ensure that the program is deeply rooted within the requirements and expectations of the community. Therefore, the field teams begin all engagements by holding community-level meetings with key stakeholders like village council members, womens self-help groups, small landholding farmers, etc. Only with key input from community members does the program design move forward. The field teams invest several months to build trust within the communities and understand gaps and opportunities in public service delivery.  As highlighted above, the government is a key collaborator. Swaniti embeds itself in the office of the local administration to ensure the requisite support systems for service delivery exists and complements it with counterparts in state offices to ensure scalability. Swaniti sees government as a critical level in ensuring the delivery of key social safety programs that can lift people out of poverty and provide them with an opportunity for better quality of life. Our government counterparts are a critical part of Swaniti's work. Finally, partnerships of local NGO partners who can help in program implementation are a key part of the program. NGOs bring in critical insights on how to operationalize local solutions within the communities and our seen as the \"local solution providers\". In this particular program, we hope to partner with the Digital Empowerment Foundation who would be bringing in their \"Soochnaprenuers\", community members who have a thorough understanding of local programs and will help tea garden workers enroll in various government initiatives. Soochnaprenuers is a program piloted and scaled by DEF. The local entreprenuers, known as Soochnaprenuers, will bring in the hyperlocal solutions needed to resolve the current knowledge and enrollment gaps of various government programs. Our past experience has shown that this is the most impactful model and therefore going forward we are focusing on the same for our current strategy.  6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):Indias local governance systems are broken. This makes it difficult for the most vulnerable to have access to basic public services that are critical to growth. 78 million people are eligible for government-funded programs. The Indian government spends over 58 billion USD on ensuring food security 42 billion on creating economic opportunities, and over 126 billion on social protection programs. Yet India is home to 20 percent of the worlds poor who are living in abject poverty. Despite the governments will to lift people out of poverty, many fall through the cracks because local administrations often dont have the tools for last-mile delivery. Local governments lack the three Ps...Grant Application Form, July 1 20138                     ...skilled people at a local level who have the knowledge, expertise, and drive to effectively execute and reach most marginalized              .meaningful civil society partnerships to complement the government efforts and create checks and balances for robust long term program delivery                .strong processes which include continuous monitoring and evaluation.  Most governance-centric efforts are concentrated at a national level. The weakest states, districts, and villages often have little or no tools to improve local governance. Yet local governments are the touch points for public services. To correct this imbalance, it is critical to work with government administrators at a local level in weak and laggard districts and states. This proposal focuses on working with local governance to be able to solve issues around social protection for tea garden workers. Based on the consultations with grassroots organizations, we learned that there is no role of middlemen/contractors in the hiring of the tea workers. The hiring happens through heredity. For instance, the original person who was hired provides replacement through some family member and the cycle goes on. Office staff are interviewed by the DBITA (Dooars Branch Indian Tea Association). Tea workers lack the required documentation for most schemes and programs. Workers don't have aadhar cards or bank accounts. However, even with an alternate id proof (if any), the process is very cumbersome in accessing programs like maternity benefit scheme. Even RTE is defunct for the tea workers. Paralegals are trained how to acquire the relevant forms etc but implementation hurdles limit possible impact levels. The impact of access to scheme is ultimately seen in developmental outcomes. These include multilayered challenges in the form of health, sanitation etc. Following aare some of the outcome challenges within the state:1. Severely compromised health infrastructure included limited doctors and medicines. 2. Tea workers do not have access to entitled ration3. Sanitation, housing and drinking water are big challenges.4. Separate electricity meters in the living quarters and the electricity bill is borne by the workers. Thus with these outcomes and broken governance systems, it is important to help strengthen the process of public service delivery of tea garden workers. Through this proposal, Swaniti hopes to address this issue.",

From this exploratory study, we hope to understand the dynamism and challenges faced by the tea workers in their ecosystem in terms of their access to social security entitlements such that an implementable and sustainable policy recommendation can be designed. The exercise will be built on the existing research studies that focus on the tea garden worker community and their vulnerability in terms of access to their entitlements. Insights from existing research studies such as Bhowmick (1982,1992, 2011, 2015), Sadhukhan (2014), Ghosh (2014), Thakur (1995) etc will serve as the base for the project.To meet the objective, the Swaniti team and it's partner will be performing the following set of activities:Conducting FGDs with constituents, semi-structured interviews, and household surveys on various socio-economic-infrastructural indicators to achieve an in-depth understanding of the on-ground situation.The findings from the field will then be substantiated by engaging with various stakeholders from different spheres, including government, civil society organizations, and grassroots partners to leverage their knowledge of institutional and local enforcement challenges and to identify needs for institutional capacity building. The Swaniti team would also conduct a pilot survey for the questionnaire testing before rolling out the final survey.Based on the survey findings and stakeholder consultations, the Swaniti team will then also map out the government processes and bottlenecks in program delivery.Since tea plantations fall under the agrarian economy it is likely that tea workers have limited or no exposure to modern skill development training or technology. Accordingly, Swaniti will leverage the expertise that it has gathered through its experience in the RESET (Roadmap for Ecological and Sustainable Energy Transformation) project in Jharkhand in employment generation and apply them for West Bengal. The indicators for skill identification will include:Number of skill development workshops conductedNumber of workers trained; the number of alternate jobs generatedGrant Application Form, July 1 2013107.1.c. Objective 1 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words): The overall objective of this phase is to identify the availability and extent of accessibility of tea workers to government welfare schemes and other entitlements by a.) conducting assessment about the current state of access and mapping Number of workers transitioned to alternate livelihoods The overall project will be carried out in three phases, a total period of 24 months to achieve the desired objectives. The first objective and the associated activities will be carried out in Phase I which is a period of 3 to 4 months. In this phase, the fieldwork will begin with data collection in at least three districts, namely Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar. Swaniti team proposes to carry out data collection in four tea estates within each district where the estates will be decided based on the following indicators:Estate Size: STGs and Large estatesStatus of the estate: profit-making closed tea estateNumber of currently employed tea workers Swaniti will also be interviewing retired tea workers. The prospective theme for data collection will comprise but not be limited to:household details (education/ nutrition statistics for children; number of dependents etc)socio-economic statusawareness and access to schemes and entitlementsdetails about working conditionsmajor challenges etc The primary study participants will include tea workers, we have found that and estate owners/managers. Secondary stakeholders include worker trade unions, nearby SHGs, Panchayat, etc. We have done an inter-district comparison between Jalpaiguri and Kooch Behar in terms of socio-economic indicators including sex ratio. The final sex ratio will be decided once the sampling strategy is finalized. However, as per our standard practice, we aim to keep an equal composition of men and women in FGDs. Additionally, Swaniti team will also engage in consultation with stakeholders including the government, field partners, like-minded CSOs, and grassroots organizations. Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) will be supported Swaniti to design the survey by leveraging their past experience of working with team garden workers in Assam. Additionally, they will expect to mobilize young people from the ground to support conducting these surveys, with the hopes that these youth can eventually become Soochnaprenuers and help inform tea garden workers about their rights and ways to access them. DEF will build on its Soochnaprenuer model from other districts and states. Grant Application Form, July 1 201311bottlenecks in the delivery of public programs b.) and; surveying and interviewing constituents to recognize limitations and opportunities.The primary study participants will include tea workers and estate owners/managers. Secondary stakeholders include worker trade unions, nearby SHGs, Panchayat, etc. Additionally, the Swaniti team will also engage in consultation with stakeholders including the government, field partners, like-minded CSOs, and grassroots organizations. Data will be collected through the following methods:( Phase 1: 3-4 months)Focus group discussions: Within each tea estate, the Swaniti Initiative team will conduct 1 FGD with a cohort of 10-15 people each. Beneficiaries will be sampled through purposive sampling in consultation with our on-ground partners. Further, the team will ensure that each focus group discussion consists of a diverse range of beneficiaries including women, tribal/ SC population, and contractual/ permanent employees. We expect that the primary resistance to enter the estate and communicate with the workers will in fact come from the garden owners. In order to counter this, we are working on a separate risk and mitigating strategy that involves working with various tea councils and the Ministry of Commerces cooperation with the Tea Board.Household surveys: Apart from the focus group discussions, in order to gain a thorough understanding of the situation on-ground and to begin developing a baseline, the Swaniti Initiative team will conduct household surveys in each estate. Households will be selected through snowball sampling. Data will be collected on various indicators including current socio-economic conditions, access to schemes, challenges being faced, etc. The sets of entitlement to the workers come from two broad sources. (i) Flagship schemes of the government through Tea Board and State government (Chai Sundari) and (ii) the now-dissolved PLA 1951 where under the Act, the entitlements are the responsibility of the estate owners and the administering the process is the responsibility of the state government. Through the baseline, we aim to understand the challenges to accessing both these.Semi-structured/ in-depth interviews: Apart from the data collection from beneficiaries, the team will be conducting interviews with other identified stakeholders to substantiate its findings from the field as well as to understand the supply side of the issue.The outcome of this phase is to understand the major challenges being faced by plantation workers in accessing benefits and identify potential interventions to address these issues.While the Swaniti team will be collecting data from the ground, the Digital Empowerment Foundation will take this opportunity to recruit young people from the community to support the on ground data collection process. These youth will also have their capacity built about the rights and services that tea garden workers should have access toward. In the upcoming phases of the program, the youth, known as Soochnaprenuers, will be expected to help in increased awareness and enrollment of tea garden workers, into government programs.   Grant Application Form, July 1 2013127.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):Objective 2 To strengthen systems and processes by collaborating with state departments and district administration and build capacity, knowledge insights, etc. of local officers to ensure tractable public program delivery by identifying interventions suited for the local context.7.2.c. Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):In this phase of the project to achieve the second objective, Swaniti will work with the district and state administration in providing program implementation support. Systems and processes strengthening and capacity building can be achieved by:Providing Technical Assistance to the Government: Swaniti team will deploy three fellows to work with the District Magistrates office and one state coordinator will be deployed to work with a nodal department. These resources will translate the working module of the recommendations into a continued government mechanism.Training and Capacity Building: To ensure that the project will keep running even after Swanitis tenure is over and in the absence of continuous involvement of on-ground partners, Swaniti will ensure that the local administration is trained for sustainable implementation of the recommendations. Swaniti team and it's partners, Digital Empowerment Foundation, will also aim to bridge the gap between the government and the community. This is important because, without this connection, there will be no advantage of proximity which can exploit transparent communication optimally. Hence, despite implementing the recommendations, there will always remain a gap between the beneficiaries lack of entitlement and /or access to the same and the governments attempt to solve the same. In this 7.2.b. Objective 2 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):In this part of the project, the set of actionable policy recommendations will be implemented thus initiating Phase II of the project. The second phase will be for a period of 12 months. The outcome of this phase would be to develop an overall set of sustainable policy frameworks containing a set of actionable recommendations and intervention strategies and implement the same at the administrative level to strengthen the governance of service delivery which will, in turn, enhance tea workers access to public programs. Accordingly, the Swaniti team seeks to engage with multiple stakeholders including:The broader outcomes of this phase are: Recommendations have been adopted by the departmentReports/ findings/ recommendations have been submitted to the departmentNew departments have been onboarded Grant Application Form, July 1 201313respect, the training of government officials will be based on the statement of purpose (SoP) of the recommendations which can be process correction/new schemes/increasing budget allocation of existing schemes, etc. This training can be done for example by conducting capacity-building workshops. The community, on the other hand, will be trained by the Soochnaprenuers who are recruited and onboarded by the Digital Empowerment Foundation. These entreprenuers will be working closely with the DEF team members to organize the most effective structure of community engagement and will be working with them to be able to setup these meetings. Additionally, through the previous phase, we would be able to gain significant data on eligible schemes and programs for tea garden workers and Soochnaprenuers would be able to gain from this knowledge and disseminate it in the community. Pilot Testing Interventions: Swaniti will support the government to pilot-test the interventions in the selected baseline geographies in order to understand the efficacy of the project. Based on the outcomes the capacity building can be updated as a part of the upscaling and course correction process.Further, there will be an advisory committee that would include subject matter and sector experts who will assist in vetting Swanitis recommendations. This advisory committee will be introduced to the government by Swaniti where their role and importance will be explained.7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):Objective 3: To establish a strong bottom-up policy framework that can be scaled across the State for larger policy adoption7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):The outcome of this phase is to create a local ecosystem of accountability and oversight by connecting civil society partners with government agencies to ensure the sustainability of the program. Swaniti will facilitate such that local NGOs hold periodical meetings with the district magistrates and provide him/her with continuous insights, state of conditions, and solutions about the tea garden workers. Additionally, the presence of local youth, Soochnaprenuers, who would be expected to continue supporting tea garden workers, will also ensure the sustainability of the program.   The Soochnapreneur model has volunteers who have door-to-door access to beneficiaries. The total number of such volunteers will be decided at a block level during the mid-term stage of the program once the first phase of adoption or implementation starts. One may consider this model very similar to a CSC ( Common service center) hub and spook ecosystem or a Banking Correspondent setup.Since we are collaborating with the Soochnapreneur program, we will be leveraging their model to ensure there is no exclusion such that the program is sustainable.Grant Application Form, July 1 2013147.3.c. Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Sharing the SoP of Recommendations with Sectoral Experts: Swaniti will assist in conducting high-level meetings with sectoral experts, bureaucrats etc where the SoP of the recommendations can be revisited and brainstormed on to obtain specialized insights on improving inclusivity and sustainability. The last two months in the final phase of the project can be dedicated for impact assessment to understand the sustainability of the The intent would be to institutionalize a culture of engagement of civil society with the government. Through this project, Swaniti aims to not just aid in short-term program delivery but also hope to create long-term systems.The medium-term output would be measured by: oThe increase in access and uptake of schemes and entitlements can be measured by the percentage of beneficiaries registering for and/or registered beneficiaries accessing the entitlements.  This can be verified with government data/surveys.oA number of changes are institutionalized within the governance systems and local ecosystem. This is only possible with a robust monitoring system created through the local civil society ecosystem. This component will focus on translating the recommendations and solutions as part of government functioning. For example, the administration might implement systems to ease the enrollment of tea garden workers into various programs. This can be a permanent change that should be implemented at a district level.  In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our interventions, Swaniti Initiative ensures the capacity building of government officials and relevant stakeholders. Grievance redressal and timely monitoring of interventions are a part of this training. This is done by establishing a strong communication channel and feedback loop between the district and state teams of Swaniti who form a point of bridge between these two administrative bodies. In Andhra Pradesh, Swaniti Initiative has successfully demonstrated this model where due to our intervention the grievances recorded have jumped from 25 complaints a month to 125 a month for the MGNREGS scheme due to our systems that have been adopted by the Dept of RD and PR.The long term output would be measured by:Change in the socio-economic parameters of the beneficiaries. This can be measured by recording the change in income, socio-economic indicators like health, education, nutrition, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, housing, etc, through government data or surveys. In short, the long-term expected outcome would be an improvement in the quality of life of the beneficiaries. Swaniti Initiative will develop a log frame identifying outputs (short term), outcomes (midterm), and impact (long term). The short-term indicators would measure factors like awareness levels, documentation for accessing entitlements, etc. The projected timeline to witness this is 7-8 months. In the medium term, the outcomes measured will include percentage increase in beneficiaries, uptake of schemes, etc. We predict approximately 12-16 months to witness this change. In the long term, Swaniti envisages better socio-economic indicators for the beneficiaries. This will be measured at the end of the project, but it might take longer than 2 years to witness the tangible socio-economic impact. Grant Application Form, July 1 201315project.Monitoring and Evaluation: Swaniti will work closely with local partners to develop a culture of periodic information sharing with the local and state administration by sharing real-time data assessment on the performance and feedback on grievances. Having a continuous monitoring system would provide the government with a ground perspective on the state of rights and services of tea garden workers and open up an active discussion with the government.Establish a Continuous Feedback Mechanism: to enable beneficiary inputs at every stage of the project by leveraging our on-field network of partner organisations, district associates, and the state lead. In this phase. Swaniti will also focus on community engagements. The field partners will play an important role as advisors in communicating the community feedback to the government to foster a culture of dialogue on public service delivery and eventually scale up the project presence. It is critical to take a constructive tone to ensure that these conversations are fruitful and sustainable. Thus, Swaniti will be leveraging its experience from other projects to ensure that this is the case in West Bengal.  Additionally, state and district fellows will analyze how community actors and government can develop a continuous feedback and course correction loop to ensure that tea garden workers continue to receive basic rights. For example, convening monthly meetings where civil society members can share key data points about how tea garden workers are performing. The convening will hope to nudge conversation about the continued gaps and possible solutions in public programs. This will also feed into the monitoring and evaluation process. This stage is expected to overlap with Phase II. The Civil society agencies can be our eyes and ears on the ground and provide critical feedback to the administration about their functioning of key programs. This can be strengthened through the development of a dashboard.",
        "8. COOPERATION": "8. CooperationDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks and explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 words):Swaniti has been continuously engaging with grassroots organizations like Nazdeek, Traidcraft, and the Family Planning Association of India. These organizations work with marginalized communities and have helped us to refine our proposal based on their on-ground insights. The organizations have provided deeper insights on violation of rights and institutional and local enforcement challenges to policy implementation. Cooperating with these organizations has highlighted issues that not only reveal violations of tea workers rights to social security but also identify implementation problems that require immediate attention. These findings include (1) since PLA is the employer's responsibility the local governments (PRIs) have moved away from Grant Application Form, July 1 201316assuming any responsibility for the welfare of tea workers despite being included in schedule 6. Also, it remains unimplemented in West Bengal; (2) most tea workers are from Oraon community but not included in ST list and hence have no access to public programs; (3) tea workers have no access to schemes like PM Kisan which are applicable to farming programs; (4) absence of labour commissioners and hence unsettled disputes related to employers provident fund persist; (5) although 50% to 60% of tea workers are women, there is a huge lack of organization bodies for women representation and they are not allowed to form SHGs; (6) high rates of school dropout, child labour where children are remunerated based on per kilo lifting basis; (7) tea workers are not allowed to migrate unless they provide replacement from family; (8) significant lack of accountability as there is a lack of audit certification for most tea estates as owners don't allow audits; (9) there is a nexus between estate owners and local administration where owners register for MNREGA with false promise of providing 100 days work to tea workers and obtain the funds without actual employment. Cooperating with this network of organizations, can help us understand the tea workers ecosystem and challenges better and hence create targeted policy interventions that can be implemented to strengthen governance for the delivery of welfare entitlements to the tea workers community.In addition to working with these organizations, Swaniti also plans on partnering with Digital Empowerment Foundation. Digital Empowerment Foundation has worked  with tea garden workers in Assam in increasing access to government programs. With a budget spent of 22 crores annually (approximately 3 million USD), Digital Empowerment Foundation has previous experience of working on large scale programs. We hope to be able to build on their experiences of working with tea garden workers and bring in ours of working with government. The partnership will allow for a strong program delivery. With DEF being a FCRA-compliant, we hope to provide a sub-grant to them through this program and have a programmatic partnership. We are in the process of finalizing the above (and have provided a tentative budget based on discussions thus far). We plan on submitting the details of finalized roles and responsibilities to Oak Foundation team members in the next month.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. ImpactWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum 300 words):Given the distressed background of tea workers, the goal of this project is to strengthen the delivery of government programs to tea garden workers. In this respect, first, Swaniti aims to improve the delivery of public programs to tea garden workers by translating the set of recommendations to government functioning. The primary focus of this impact of the project is to create a sustainable program delivery change to secure the social rights and entitlements and access to government programs by strengthening implementation. For instance, through this project as the gaps and challenges in accessibility and provision of tea workers entitlements and reasons for the same are identified, Swaniti aims to highlight whether there is (a) complete absence of some socio-economic entitlements; (b) difficulty in access to the same; (c) impediments in the delivery mechanism at the Grant Application Form, July 1 201317administration level which requires process correction, etc. Following the identification, Swaniti will work with the administration and other stakeholders in correcting the loopholes. For instance, if the main obstacle is administrative process impediment, Swaniti with work in tandem with the administration with the help of the district and state fellows to correct the same. Further, to achieve sustainable adoption of the recommendations, Swaniti will work towards utilization of funds from the Government's side. We would ensure that the policy recommendations that get adopted will have a separate budget head or mobilize the government to allocate under-utilized funds that make the program institutionalized. The second impact Swaniti aims to achieve is to create a local ecosystem of accountability. Swaniti aims to achieve this impact by engaging the community with civil society partners and grassroots organizations through regular sessions where the tea workers can update their existing conditions and whether there has been any tangible change. This feedbacks will then go to the government through the civil society members to create a continuous feedback and correction mechanism which will ensure the sustainability of the program.10. EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):For evaluation, a monthly monitoring system will be put in place in the form of an excel tracker the team leads or a person appointed by the lead will update the monthly deliverables at the beginning of each month. At the month-end, the tracker will be updated with the actual outputs. This will enable us to map the monthly deliverables with the actual progress. The tracker will also note the reasons for being unable to achieve the monthly deliverables, the challenges faced, mitigation strategy to ensure a course-correction mechanism. This includes gathering insights on the process being followed, external and internal challenges faced as a team, and feedback to make the process more effective and efficient. Process monitoring will be further substantiated by a quarterly HR review, conducted through anonymous surveys. All team members will fill in their responses, to track their views on challenges being faced and means to improve on the project. Problems of a severe nature can be addressed by the HR/project lead, as convenient. This will provide a space for the individual team members to provide their views on the workings of the project. Apart from these, the M&E team will also carry out spot checks and back-checks to ensure the quality of data being collected. For impact assessment, every 6 months, there will be a medium-term outcome evaluation report which will assess if the targeted outputs have been achieved or not as per the pre-defined project design and goals. At the end of the project, a broader impact assessment will be carried out which along with outcome evaluation, will also assess the impact of the project on the lives of beneficiaries/key stakeholders/change in governance mechanisms, etc. through a pre-post assessment methodology. In addition to this Swaniti Initiative follows the recommended 2-5% allocation for MEL activities. This is a best practice based on Development Assistance Committee (DAC) recommendations for OECD. Just to explain this in a bit more detail, Swaniti Initiative will follow a pre-post Grant Application Form, July 1 201318methodology to measure outputs, outcome, and impact. Our internal Evaluation framework comprises 4 key performance indicators centers around systems and processes, bottom-up planning, capacity building, and mobilizing public finance for key welfare programs. Apart from these, the team in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders and will develop a detailed log frame to identify project-specific output and outcome indicators and the ways of measuring the same.",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future PlansHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum 300 words):As mentioned in the previous section, this project is part of Swanitis larger goal of being able to create models of effective implementation in social welfare programs at the state level. Having models of excellence will allow creating a national program for countrywide improvement since we would be able to showcase the steps taken for more inclusive and accessible government schemes and programs. The focus of this program being rights and entitlements of tea garden workers would help create one such intervention that can be showcased to NITI, PMO, and other state governments for larger adoptions. Swaniti will hope to take the learning from this particular condition to other districts and states and provide pointed feedback on how to bring systemic change. We have already initiated many of these practices. For example, we are bringing our experiences of working on job creation in Jharkhand to West Bengal. Similarly, we plan on taking these experiences to other states as well. We see this program as being pivotal to our future work of strengthening systems and processes in governance.",

In 2008, we established a locally registered arm governed by an eight-member board, Water For People India Trust. Since 2011, we have applied the Everyone Forever model, a long-term approach focused on sustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. Applying our Everyone Forever model, with its emphasis on partnerships with local governments and communities, has resulted in significant progress towards the completion and rehabilitation of improved water and sanitation systems, strengthened by municipal and local structures. This transformative WASH program in India is helping Everyone  every community, household, school, and clinic  gain access to these critical resources across 10 districts/blocks in West Bengal in South 24 Parganas (Sagar Island, Oak Application Form     6Patharpratima, Namkhana) and Birbhum (Rajnagar), in Bihar, Sheohar (Sheohar block, Dumri Katsari, Piprahi, Traini Chowk, and Purnahiya), and in Maharashtra, Amravati (Chikhaldara). Eight districts/blocks now have new or improved water services in all communities, the five blocks of Sheohar (Bihar), Sagar Island, Patharpratima, and Rajnagar (West Bengal) and seven have new or improved water services in all households, including Patharpratima.  These efforts have resulted in intermediate or high levels of water services for 1,548,915 people across 10 Everyone Forever districts/blocks, affecting 93% of the population in these blocks. These areas include five blocks in Sheohar (Bihar), Chikhaldara block in Amravati (Maharashtra), and four blocks in West Bengal. Water For People and Panchayat and Rural Development Department (Governments of West Bengal and Bihar) have signed Memorandum of Understandings in which Water For People formed a Technical Support Unit with embedded staff to assist government flagship programs such as Jal Jeevan Mission. The Unit provides support to these departments for community engagement, program management, capacity building and training of state, district, and local level officials. This support aims to assist these states to achieve the ambitious goals of the Jal Jeevan Mission (a functional household water tap connection to all households in rural India by 2024), SBM Phase II, and Jal Shakti Abhiyan (water conservation initiative). This Unit also works with communities to develop plans and models to manage their water resources.  Water resources in the areas where we work in India are severely affected by climate change. There are more frequent tropical storms, sea levels are rising, and drought persists. Erratic rainfall, changes in timing, intensity and duration of precipitation has adversely affected surface water, putting additional pressure on ground water resources. Water For People India aligns its water resources management (WRM) activities with the Indian governments water conservation initiative, Jal Shakti AbhiyanCatch the rain when it falls where it falls. We provide training to master trainers, guiding them to work closely with communities and villages to develop climate resilient Village Water Safety and Security Plans (VWSSPs). These plans include budgets for conducting water quality testing, measuring water sources, and planning availability. Under these plans, Water for People supports the installation of aquifer storage units, ridge and furrow models, and creation of recharge pits for surface water management. VWSSPs are incorporated into Gram Panchayat Development Plans. We also work with farmers to reduce pumping needs for irrigation. In addition, in schools, we install roof top rainwater harvesting systems to serve as an alternative/supplemental water source.  5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your Oak Application Form     7communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Water For People is very familiar with the Sundarbans challenges, having working in Parganas, West Bengal since 1996. This area has a population of 2.79 million living in about 1,100 villages. Most people, including many from scheduled tribes and castes, live in acute poverty and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. This region is very vulnerable to climate changes frequent cyclones, floods, and sea-level rise. These events have led to saline soil, seawater intrusion, aquifer contamination, brackish aquaculture ponds, and increased incidence of waterborne diseases. Progressive salinization of rivers and groundwater has resulted in the decline of available fresh drinking water. The demand for groundwater has increased to meet increasing demand for crops, which, combined with limited rainfall, is resulting in the over-extraction of groundwater and a severe crisis during the summer.  Based on our experience, all activities that Water For People India carries out in communities related to water security aim to build resilience as part of the overarching goal of communities surviving climate change. A community cannot survive climate change if water sources are not secure, namely accessible and of sufficient quantity and quality. The people contributing the least to climate change are suffering the most. We cannot continue to wait for mitigation efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to correct the injustice.?It is time for the people directly facing threats to their water sources to have resources necessary to adapt.? We plan to use Oak Foundations funding to strengthen integrated water resources management (IWRM) in Patharpratima and Gosaba, two blocks with ecosystems highly vulnerable to cyclones. In Patharpratima block, 23% of the population is Schedule Caste, 0.8% is Schedule Tribe. In Gosaba block, 62.7% is Schedule Caste, 9.5% is Schedule Tribe. We will work closely with community leaders and members, particularly those from marginalized groups such as Schedule Castes and Tribes, and women.  This work will empower those community leaders to lead efforts to adapt to climate change by ensuring water security.?IWRM acknowledges the pivotal role of water as a finite resource and advocates for its judicious allocation using a comprehensive approach to address the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, particularly for tribal communities. These communities are often reliant on local water sources for sustenance with IWRM offering enhanced water security. By implementing sustainable practices such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and efficient irrigation methods, women who traditionally bear the responsibility of water collection, can experience reduced physical burden and increased access to clean water.  IWRM can also serve as an educational tool, enhancing tribal communities' understanding of hydrological processes, water conservation strategies, and climate change impacts. This knowledge empowers everyone, especially women, to make informed decisions regarding water use and management, producing a culture of environmental stewardship and adaptive learning. Also as women are primary users of water, they are interested in learning Oak Application Form     8the scientific and social context of ground water depletion as it greatly impacts their daily lives, and how to put into practice newly acquired knowledge for the community's benefit. IWRM also enhances public health through improved water quality due to IWRM's emphasis on monitoring water quality, pollution control, and watershed management. By mitigating waterborne diseases and contamination, tribal communities experience improved overall well-being and reduced healthcare burdens, particularly benefitting women in tribal communities through improved maternal and child health. For women's empowerment, IWRM and the approaches proposed are inherently transformative as it involves women in decision-making processes related to water management, challenging traditional gender roles and amplifying women's voices. Participation in water committees, resource planning, and advocacy initiatives elevates their status and influence within the community, nurturing a more gender-equitable society. In addition, IWRM can catalyze diversification of livelihoods by integrating water-sensitive agricultural practices and aquaculture. This not only mitigates climate risks but also stimulates economic growth within tribal communities, reducing their vulnerability to external shocks. By enhancing water security, supporting education, promoting health, elevating women's empowerment, and augmenting livelihoods, IWRM becomes a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable development. To strengthen IWRM, Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo propose to build on the tested approach of participatory groundwater management (PGWM) for select villages in the Sundarbans. This approach incorporates a deep understanding of surface and groundwater interactions and values and incorporates community knowledge to solve complex water problems. Successful implementation of PGWM requires an understanding of groundwater science from the perspective of the local population too.  Firstly, within the Participatory Groundwater Management (PGWM) process, the community will engage in the mapping of IWRM activities and models currently in place. It is necessary to validate the traditional IWRM models using scientific methods. Subsequently, this knowledge will be disseminated to the community through various platforms, leading to the development of a comprehensive community plan focused on ensuring the sustainability of water sources. As a result, the PGWM process will involve the identification of different categories of traditional IWRM models, with particular attention given to identifying models that have been damaged or reduced in effectiveness. During the execution phase, appropriate modifications will be made to ineffective traditional IWRM models either with direct support or with convergence from government departments.? We will nurture local leaders and community-based institutions, particularly among women-led Self-Help Groups, supporting them to map the aquifers, delineate resources, facilitate water budgeting, and scenario building for managing water. In addition, we will combine outcomes of community-based water quality mapping with predictive analysis models leveraging available and relevant historical data for community and local institutions to make informed decisions regarding the sustainability of their water sources. We intend to act as enablers, with local communities and their institutions Oak Application Form     9driving the process. Since PRASARI and Water For People have built trust in communities in these blocks for years, interventions will begin quickly.  Participatory approaches and IWRM require investments of time and resources before fully realizing benefits. We will use Oak Foundations funding to design the program and activities together with the government, traditional leaders from schedule castes and tribes, and local communities. We will facilitate discussions between local government and communities to ensure sustainability by creating an advisory committee that includes senior government officials from state and district governments, local elected bodies, and Panchayati Raj Institution members. We will involve traditional leaders, developing a cadre of communities to build their capacity to plan, budget, and develop demonstration of freshwater harvesting and aquifer recharging models for three years. After the close of the initial project, we will build on investments and link communities to government campaigns/ resources to fund water security plans and infrastructure solutions. As Water For People is embedded in the West Bengal state government, we will foster incorporating water security plans into Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).  In addition to incorporating these plans in GPDPs, locally elected bodies and Panchayati Raj Institution members will play an important role in decision making to leverage government resources. From project inception to capacity building exercises and workshops to develop community-led water security plans and solutions, vulnerable community members, traditional leaders, and locally elected bodies will participate in every stage. We will ensure regular communication among all stakeholders and jointly celebrate successes. By aligning water security plans with existing government schemes (Jal Jeevan Mission) and programs, we will also facilitate efforts to ensure that community institutions and their representatives receive government acknowledgement to access water security financing. Within communities, we will apply Elinor Ostroms principles to strengthen community-based institutions. We recognize that based on data collected and analyzed, these principles may be modified to fit the Sundarbans challenges such as cyclones. We will embed possibilities for modifications. Participatory planning along with building capacity of local communities will result in the development of evidence-based water security plans with local community leaders conducting water budgeting, identifying potential recharge areas, and/or expanding traditional water harvesting practices. In addition to these activities, demonstration models complete with freshwater harvesting or aquifer recharge solutions will be completed in select villages of Patharpratima and Gosaba blocks. Informed by data and depending on community consensus, solutions could include land shaping for furrow and high ridge cultivation, Five Square water harvesting structures that PRASARI has implemented in Gosaba, aquifer storage and recovery systems, and/or rooftop rainwater harvesting systems with tanks. In general, PGWM may seem like a niche topic. But at its core, PGWM builds capacities of communities to map and manage their own resources, generates local employment (e.g., barefoot hydrogeologists), and empowers local communities to make data-driven decisions. Our initial projections suggest that about 200 barefoot hydrogeologists and the corresponding 1,000 water and sanitation committees will participate. It's important to note that this is a preliminary estimation, and the final figures may vary. Oak Application Form     10Oak Foundation's investment in PGWM will show the multi-faceted successful outputs of this approach to strengthen IWRM, allowing other large funders to leverage this water-focused method to achieve their outcomes related to job creation, community development, and climate change adaptation. The three organizations (Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo) work with several donors that are interested in climate-water-food nexus and/or livelihood development, such as Caterpillar Foundation, Welthungerhilfe (WHH), Axis Bank Foundation (ABF), and Ajim Premji Philanthropic Foundation. We also work closely with global knowledge platforms like World Water Quality Alliance and Water Point Data Exchange, which have a keen interest in the Sundarbans, SDGs and specifically water quality. There are also talks with donors that are showing interest in citizen engagement, data-based decision making and collective action. We will leverage Water For Peoples Technical Support Unit and embedded staff in West Bengals state government and agreement with the Public Health and Engineering Department (in Birbhum and South 24 Parganas District) to ensure government convergence in this program.  We also propose to establish a multi-stakeholder platform that includes local Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), such as Oak Partners, in collaboration with Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo. The objective of this platform would be to facilitate learning, sharing, implementation, and scaling up of the interventions within and beyond the project locations. We propose to conduct an annual sharing workshop with our partners to provide a more detailed update on the results and the processes followed to arrive at those results. In this workshop, we will encourage feedback from the partners and use this as an opportunity for cross learning.",

If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):Water For People India has been working in West Bengal/ the Sundarbans for 20+ years. PRASARI, our partner in this region for 10+ years, works closely with local communities. PRASARI is currently working with Water For People in four blocks in West Bengal, with communities on improving water services, integrating water resources management, rainwater Oak Application Form     14harvesting and building recharge structures. Akvo Foundation and Water For People have a decade-old partnership across the globe generating evidence for program decision making. As program lead, Water For People India will lead project design, establish learning processes, liaise with Oak Foundation and relevant government departments, communicate regularly to all stakeholders, create policy and public facing communications, and submit required reports. We will also leverage our relationship with West Bengals state government to link these communities to government resources.  PRASARI will support on-ground implementation. PRASARI will focus on strengthening social capital, building community capacity while incorporating traditional knowledge, facilitating aquifer mapping, water budgeting, and water security planning. It will apply Ostroms principles for management of commons1, modifying as necessary and developing processes that can sustain momentum after the project has ended. In early stages of community interactions with local administration, PRASARI will act as a facilitator. Akvo is our technology and data partner, using appropriate technology to help us to report and build evidence. Local communities will use Akvos tools to collect data and information. Akvo will analyze data, summarize findings, indicate trends, and develop data visualizations that Water For People and PRASARI will use for community engagement and to promote policy and model scale up. Akvo will work closely with Water For People to develop documentation useful for replicating and scaling up this program in similar contexts.  Additionally, Water For People and Prasari will leverage their other donors working in West Bengal that are interested in the climate-water-food nexus and/or livelihood development, such as Caterpillar Foundation and Ajim Premji Philanthropic Foundation.  We will also establish a multi-stakeholder platform that includes local CSOs, such as Oak Foundation Partners, in collaboration with Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo. The objective of this platform would be to facilitate learning, sharing, implementation, and scaling up of the interventions within and beyond the project locations. We will work with these stakeholders (Oak partners and non-Oak partners) from the very beginning to identify the operational villages and ensure integration with other issues from the outset. The operational villages will be selected based on the vulnerability mapping of the Gram Panchayats (an administrative unit that represents a cluster of villages). To conduct vulnerability mapping, a participatory tool will be used to assess 15 indicators distributed across four categories: Social, Climatic, Institutional and Economic.  Social:  i. Ratio of Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribal & Other Backward Caste(s) ration to total population, ii. Literacy Rate, iii. Rate of migration to total no of families, iv. Ratio of total number of toilet blocks to total number of households. Climate: i. Ratio of vulnerable river embankment to total embankment, ii. Climatic disaster impact ratio (Ratio of number of disaster(s) in a Oak Application Form     15particular year with average number of climate disaster in last 10 years, iii. Ratio of total submergent area to total area. Institutional: i. Rate of migration to total number of families, ii. Child mortality rate, iii. Participation of women to the labor force, iv. Average number of families dependent on drinking water from tube wells, v. Ratio of average distance from school, Panchayat and hospital to national average. Economic:  i. Ratio of mono-cropped and double cropped area, ii. Ratio of waterborne diseases to non-communicable diseases, iii. UN Household Dietary Diversity Score,  iv. Average income from farm-based livelihoods and manufacturing + service sector.These indications have been carefully outlined, agreed upon in public forums, and weighed uniformly. In addition, it is evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale, with the combined scores for each metric serving as the final evaluation. Gram Panchayats (GP) with a score of less than 2.5 are at risk of vulnerability. If a vulnerable GP is identified, all its corresponding revenue villages will be included for implementation. As GPs are clusters of villages without further assessment, we incorporate all the revenue villages of a vulnerable GP for action.??",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING This section is twofold. Please tell us:a) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):The project team (Water For People, PRASARI and Akvo) will employ effective MEL mechanisms (includes practices and tools) that provides a structured approach to track project progress, assess impact, and foster continuous learning in a comprehensive and meaningful way.  The following points describe our approach: - We will jointly design theory and pathways of change to create a logical framework to understand how our intended project activities will lead to the desired outcomes and impact. This step is critical as it underpins every aspect of the proposed project's implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. During the design step, we will develop results framework, a high-level Oak Application Form     16structure, that outlines the project's objectives, outcomes, indicators, activities, inputs, and assumptions in a concise manner. - We will flesh-out an Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework from the project results framework focused on how monitoring and evaluation will be conducted to track progress. We will develop a well-structured monitoring plan to transform the M&E framework into actionable steps by outlining the methodologies, responsibilities, timelines, and resources required for effective project monitoring. At project inception, the team will outline data needs and data use (for reporting, community, dissemination, advocacy, and decision making) based on the M&E framework. To measure progress and impact accurately, the project team will jointly design and implement baseline and endline assessments. For concurrent monitoring, the team will design data collection instruments (qualitative and quantitative) aligned with the indicators and ensure these are user-friendly and capture the required information accurately. Additionally, we will leverage on Water For People's current resources, including internal tracking spreadsheets, biannual reports, and the Sustainable Services Checklist for water and sanitation. Our approach involves enhancing such existing data and processes to optimize their effectiveness for the proposed project.  - We will employ real-time (near real-time) progress tracking of key performance indicators and milestones to gain insights into how the project is advancing toward its set targets across the time and space of the project context. We will use technology and data to provide up-to-date information about the project's status, enabling swift decision-making and adjust strategies/activities based on real-time data and learning. Akvo will enable a centralized web-based platform to monitor project data and prepare a predictive analysis model/simulation for forecasting conditions that impact water sources and make informed decisions about the sustainability of their water sources.  - We will integrate Data-Driven Insights into project operations to conduct realistic assessment of project achievements and challenges and incorporate a learning component in the project plan. These insights will reveal trends, patterns, and areas of improvement in the project.  We will also use these insights to develop adaptive strategies and refine our approach during project implementation. These may include insights that help us assess what elements of our interventions are working and if there is a need to improve/change project activities and/or intervention logic. The project team will utilize appropriate analytical techniques to derive and present insights using compelling visualizations to enhance understanding and communicate project findings to project stakeholders in a clear and accessible manner.  In a broader sense, these monitoring insights will contribute to the collective learning of all project stakeholders, including the project donor. Additionally, the project team will create learning documentation to be shared with Oak Foundation partners both within the current project area and in other regions. We will jointly conduct the baseline and endline assessments.  Akvo will develop a web-based platform to track project data and also prepare a predictive analysis model/simulation for forecasting conditions that impact water sources and make informed decisions about the sustainability of their water sources. We will also build on Water For Peoples existing tools, such as the Sustainable Services Checklist for water and sanitation which includes Oak Application Form     1711 indicators with specific criteria to meet, particularly for Water Resources Management.  We anticipate that by adopting a participatory approach, villages will teach all partners about the challenges they face and solutions they may have already attempted. We will apply these learnings to demonstrate models for interventions. Learnings in the form of reports and policy briefs will be shared with Block, District and State administration officials to identify the implementation issues and to gain buy-in on successful models. Learnings in the form of blogs, success stories will be shared on different social media platforms. Water For People will also share data with World Water Quality Alliance and Water Point Data Exchange and results with wider audiences as relevant such as during World Water Week and the All Systems Connect symposium. We will create a culture of using data for decision making and ensure community engagement and active participation in water security planning by implementing the following strategies:? At the projects outset, we will engage community members to collaboratively design the water security plans within the project's regions. This approach ensures ownership, cultivates awareness, and familiarizes them with the nuances of the planning process. Our intent is to create a culture of using data to make decisions and align incentives (improving water security, lives and livelihoods) to sustain the habit beyond the tenure of a project.? We will ensure the project data about the water security planning process is transformed into simple, clear and actionable information that local communities and their governments (GP, block and district) can understand and utilize to make key water management decisions. Water user communities will be involved in the design of data collection and analysis process (what data to collect, who would do the analysis, in what form the analyzed data will be available to make decisions). Based on the user feedback, we will create a set of quantitative and qualitative tools. Local communities will be trained to field test the tools, give feedback, and help improve the tools. We will also engage members of local communities (Self Help Groups and other community-based organizations) to collect the actual data, be involved during the analysis and present the data back to their fellow community members.? We will ensure communities are actively involved in the periodic (most likely annual) updates of water security plans to ensure that the plans remain relevant, effective, and aligned with the evolving needs and priorities of the community.??",

Summarise the projects ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)The projects ultimate goal to enable identified groups of people in Sunderban to come together to diagnose their vulnerabilities , articulate aspiration  and avenue of change and produce a plan for acting upon vulnerabilities as well as achieving highest standard of cooperation among collaborating organisations, leading to deep institutionalisation of values of partnership and commitment for the community-led approaches to development.  In India, Sunderbans lies in the vast delta on the Bay of Bengal formed by the super confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and the Meghna rivers. The place has always earned a special interest in the world map because of its uniqueness of the Mangrove forests and the lifestyle of the local inhabitants. People have been mostly dependent on agriculture and fishing. Owing to recent climatic changes, there is evidence of livelihood dearth adding to increasing vulnerability amongst all sections of the inhabitants. Interventions and support from the various local level organizations, government schemes have remained detrimental to the development of this area. Day-by-day, people are becoming increasingly dependent on immediate support rather than making themselves more reliant and capacitated by participating in sustainable processes of growth and development.Among the 15 Blocks in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, Pathar Pratima is one of the largest blocks and known as one of the critical blocks in terms of adverse social issues. The various publications and researches have pointed towards the increasing adversities related to human trafficking, increasing migration, insufficient alternatives to livelihood, frequent disasters in this block leading to severe adverse consequences on all section of inhabitants.Herambagopalpur Gram Panchayat is located in the northern side of the Patharpratima Block. The size of the area is about 868.3 hectares. It comprises 4 main villages, namely, Heramba Gopalpur, Dakshin Kashinagar, Kuemuri and Purba Surendranagar. Kuemuri in the Dakshin Kashinagar in the South-East surrounds Heramba Gopalpur along the Matla river. A total of 17 Sansads are included in these 4 villages.Due to its deltaic location, the river network forms the major transport system of this area and people are dependent on the river both for transportation and livelihood. Being located in the deltaic region, the rivers here are tidal in nature. The area remains flooded mostly during the rainy season and the situation worsens at times of natural calamities. Breaching of river embankments, river bank erosion are thus very common phenomena here. All these natural calamities have an adverse effect on the people residing there. Remoteness and undeveloped infrastructural facilities add to irreparable damages of life and property.   MUKTI has been working for the underprivileged people in the Sundarban area since 2003. Interventions at Patharpratima Block by Mukti started almost 5-6 years back. More than 70 students in the Herambagopalpur GP are being benefited through the Mukti Support School Centres. The women empowerment programme focussing on developing entrepreneurship skills through the MCDF project includes almost 1200 women from the GP. Mukti aims to continue ongoing such initiatives to achieve sustainable development for these people.",

What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):Mukti is working towards an enabling environment for the community people so that these people are capacitated in such a way that they are able to identify their vulnerabilities and address them to reduce their vulnerability. In the process of doing that, Mukti has helped the community people to identify their own problems and people have been able to come up with solutions related to livelihood, dearth in resources, disaster preparedness, gender equality, education, health, adolescent problems and at the same time have also been able to identify ways to mitigate them from their own levels. These problems are related to agriculture, fishing and honey collection and how improvement can be brought into them. Community people have discussed about gender discrimination, evidence of drop out among school children, absence of basic health facilities in the communities, especially for women, impact of frequent disasters and how important is disaster preparedness essential in the community along with problems of deforestation and was to address them.

This is a great opportunity to understand the socio-economic-cultural contexts of the community and accordingly plan with them the future steps.While working in the community, Mukti has observed certain challenges as well. Firstly, it has been noticed that the community people are very much influenced by the local politicians in each and every step. All schemes, provisions are very much influenced by the politicians and the community is divided into  privileged and the underprivileged. Secondly, frequent disasters have hampered the functioning of the community severely. Everytime, such disasters have been havoc and people have lost everything. It is very difficult for the community people to re-start, even though that becomes difficult because of the severe financial crunch. Thirdly, the current pandemic situation has not improved overall in the rural areas. People restrain outsiders from coming inside, many have lost jobs, demoralized and uncertain when the situation will improve and if there will be any scope to get back to work. The pandemic has jeopardized the families leading to precipitating other adverse social issues. Fourthly, the capacity of the community people in terms of motivation and willingness has severely been hit by the various calamities and other factors in the community. Hence, the outcomes expected are long term and have to undergo continuous process",

Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)Kamonohashi Project was founded in 2002 in Japan, aiming at combatting human trafficking of children for commercial sexual exploitation in the world. It started the projects in Cambodia where the child trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation was rampant, and it focused (1) to build community-based factory for the most vulnerable populations in rural Cambodia not to take the risk of unsafe migration, and (2) to support police training to strengthen the prosecution against traffickers. With the gradual shift of the issue, Kamo embarked on the global field study and concluded to support India in 2012. Kamos support in India aims to strengthen access to justice by the survivors of human trafficking through systems strengthening approach. Kamo facilitates breaking polarization in development debates through dialogue and deep listening. Kamo also strongly believes in leadership development in survivors and among organizational founders and second line leaders to strengthen the ecosystem of the civil society. In 2022, after three-year internal dialogue, Kamo decided to shift from mission-driven to the principle-based organization, and the new principle, Dignity for All, was approved by its General Assembly. Key achievements are;1. Kamo handed over the Cambodia Programme to build further social leadership programme using the community-based factory. This process was handled professionally with financial transaction, and this type of business succession was of a rare case in the Japanese social sector;2. Kamo built, nurtured and supported Tafteesh Programme since 2013, and Tafteesh received the Stop Slavery Collaboration Award from the Thomson Reuters Foundation in 2022;Kamo is supported by 14,999 subscribed supporters as of May 2023. The fundraising model of Kamo is recognized as successful and unique in Japanese civil societies. The donations from those individual supporters have been enabling Kamo to design and support strategic programmes based on the contextual needs in India.5c.

If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Secondary Research on Global Prevention of Human Trafficking (Balu et al, 2021) under the last phase of Tafteesh revealed that (1) prevention of human trafficking is defined in a highly varied manner, depending upon the approach to human trafficking, (2) vulnerability to trafficking may show a stronger correlation with relative poverty rather than absolute poverty, (3) communities and systems sustain vulnerability through permissive Oak Application Form     7environment that prevent quick identification of victims, and (4) the research calls for ecological, holistic and multidisciplinary approaches, reiterating that single-focused interventions will not impact the overall vulnerability of populations that are at risk of trafficking (Attachment 3).Preventing Trafficking: Sustainable developmental solutions to combat trafficking (Change Mantras, 2021) under the last phase of Tafteesh also clarified that (1) there is no cogent policy on prevention of trafficking either in India or other parts of the world, (2) most anti trafficking programmes focus on responses to trafficking, rather than pre-emptively seeking to mitigate or prevent exploitations or violations that lead to trafficking, and (3) interventions are largely community based and making parents more responsible to prevent their children from being trafficked, and they lack the clarity of responsibility of duty-bearers such as district administration, panchayat and police in prevention (Attachment 4).West Bengal is reportedly one of the most affected states by human trafficking and has been a high prevalence state according to the National Crime Records (Attachment C). Existing anti trafficking policies, laws or programmes, by the government or NGOs do not seem to have created any dent on the prevalence. Anti trafficking interventions have long focused on responsive initiatives - rehabilitation of survivors, reparation and penalisation of offenders. Even though all instruments on human trafficking to address prevention, there are, in fact, very few policies, laws or programmes that are focused on prevention, not only in West Bengal, but across India.Tafteesh is one of the largest and most significant civil society led anti trafficking initiative in India today, that has mobilised and organised survivors of sex trafficking in North and South 24 Parganas in West Bengal and have succeeded in establishing survivor led initiatives in claiming rehabilitation and protection services from local governments, administration and health service providers, claiming compensation and assert rights to accountability from law enforcement agencies, legal services authorities and the judicial system in prosecution of traffickers. This led to the question - now that community based organisations and survivor collectives in these two districts that have become empowered to design and take action, how would it address the gap in absence of any preventative measures on human trafficking?The Preventing Trafficking research indicated distinguishable patterns and differences in opinion on effective prevention between youth and adults, state duty bearers and common people. The research also identified information gaps in areas of labour trafficking, trafficking in men and boys, trafficking in transgender persons as well as underlying factors that explain higher vulnerability amongst people from scheduled caste and Muslims[1].The opportunities emerged through the last two phases to build on this prevention piece is the survivor collectives, people who are victims of labour trafficking seeking support services, the enhanced capacities of the NGOs, the wide network of Tafteesh which include established connections with the legal, law enforcement and other relevant departments. This request from Oak Foundation is to enable Tafteesh to build on and implement diverse and unique prevention approaches relevant to local contexts based on rights-based and community-based initiatives in West Bengal.Oak Application Form     8[1] That Muslims and SC have a disproportionate vulnerability was claimed by social workers, activists and survivors who participated in the research, based on their own experiences, data and observations.",

        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONSPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak programme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. 1. How will this phase ensure that the survivor groups play a larger role in defining strategy and interventions undertaken by Tafteesh. Please highlight the strategic approaches and processes through which the survivor groups will have enhanced participation in designing and implementing the prevention approaches.(a) Tafteesh member organisations will conduct refresher trainings and workshops with survivors to help them understand Tafteesh and a programme, its goals, objectives and activities, (b) share the monthly or quarterly cumulative reports with them to increase their understanding, (c) the Programme Manager gets workshops done with the survivors collectives to identify their critiques and recommendations, and lastly, (d) each member organisation shall implement the monitoring recommendations that come from survivors from these workshops. 2. As the Anti-Trafficking legislation currently pending in parliament, what will be the TMCs strategy to ensure that all groups (survivors, sex workers etc.) voices are factored in the legislation? This we understand is a larger objective of TMC and ties into the prevention domain. So therefore the application should outline the broad strategies on this.The three broad strategies: (a) support ILFAT to raise demand for legal reform with funding to build the narrative, (b) support allies to get domestic funding to renew litigation in the Supreme Court using research on impact of ITPA and Oak Application Form     14section 370, the litigation may be filed by any of the survivors, and (c) support Vimukthi to establish to its action in Andhra Pradesh on co-holding sex workers' rights agenda with the agenda of trafficked victims, and support them and the state government to take it to the centre. 3. What is the arrangement and why such a mode of engagement is followed? Please address this question in the Additional Questions  Section 11.Based on the risk assessment studies done by four legal and consulting firms in India in 2018 and 2019, Kamos Board decided to hire all team members as full-time consultants through third party payroll service. This has been practiced by multiple international foundations as well as UN agencies for decades, and this is a part of Kamos risk-mitigation strategies when it does not have any registered office in India. Strategic Alliance Management Services Ltd. (https://www.sams.co.in/) is the contract holder of all Kamo India team members, and Kamo and SAMS are in this arrangement since 2020. 4. About Tafteesh Organizational Mission and HistoryTafteesh was formed in a response to its action research conducted in 2013, and it is the platform of 6 social impact organisations, 2 legal teams, 12 member survivor collectives, Change Mantras (CM) for programme directorship and Kamonohashi Project (Kamo) as fund manager.  The platform has grown from 3 organisations and Kamonohashi to the current size with the annual budget increased from USD 45,680 to USD 447,335. Survivors are at the centre of the programme, and 246 survivors of trafficking as of May 2023 plays the role of collaborator, feedback provider, monitor and advisor to the Tafteesh Management Committee, as well as co-implementor and co-planner with grassroots NGOs and legal teams.Tafteesh is a Justice Programme for and with survivors of human trafficking, including children (girls and boys) and adults (women and men), for sexual exploitation and forced labour that aims to provoke state and national governments of India to develop policies, laws and systems and to allocate resources for rights of survivors and to protect rights of communities vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation in migration. For this mission, followings are the key achievements of Tafteesh;Development of Tafteeshs prevention strategy, theory of change (Attachment B) and objectives, based on the community-based research conducted by survivors and social activists;Stigma reduction in survivors, survivors have organised themselves into organisations and have formed Indias first survivors exclusive leadership forum called Indian Leadership Forum Against Trafficking (ILFAT) in 2019;Empowerment of CBOs in anti-trafficking programming. CBOs are skilled with case-management based practice, which enables CBOs to hold district administrations accountable. CBOs are also skilled to provide legal services to survivors both for victim compensation and prosecution of traffickers, making legal services available from DLSA and private lawyers, escalating dereliction of duties or faulty investigations in cases to High Court using protest petitions or appeal.Oak Application Form     15 5. Please state the factors behind prevalence of trafficking.Indias policy on rehabilitation is ineffective, with poor rates of trauma-recovery, economic security or social assimilation or protection from stigma. This systemic neglect alienates survivors from the State. Because India does not have a rehabilitation policy nationally or in any state, the role and accountability of duty bearers - Panchayats, administration, health departments remains fuzzy. This leaves survivors vulnerable to further violence in families and communities, and results in domestic violence and re-trafficking. Investigations of cases of human trafficking are handled by the general police stations with limited resources and structural support for interstate investigations. The chain of crime is not investigated or established leading to poor case for prosecution. The non functioning of Anti Human Trafficking Units leads to poor conviction rates to deter trafficking crimes across states over years. Poor rate of access of compensations by survivors is a result of lack of the implementation of victim compensation scheme by Legal Services Authorities across states. Due to the lack of prevention policy throughout the country, the roles and responsibilities of government duty-bearers to prevent human trafficking remains unclear to all. Lack of investment in survivors leadership in the sector lead to lack of inclusion of survivors as active agents in designing, implementing and monitoring interventions contributes to the fragmentation and also results in lack of ownership, sustainability and alignment of anti trafficking approaches with needs of communities vulnerable to trafficking. 6.

Bhagwati, (former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India) as the founding President, followed by noted playwright Vijay Tendulkar and Dr. Aruna Roy, among others. Over the years, NCAS has gained recognition as a premiere institution in policy research and governance in India and global south. NCAS has over 29 years of experience in capacity development, knowledge creation, networking in public policy and governance in India and internationally. It has trained leaders in academia, journalism, policy think tanks in India and 30 countries in the world. NCAS believes proper policy and its governance can create huge differences in the lives of millions of people. NCAS pioneered the idea of people centered advocacy, enabling marginalized communities to participate in the process of policy advocacy.Since last 29 years, NCAS is actively engaged in capacity development, research and knowledge creation, campaign support, social movement and knowledge networking and media with a particular focus on the policy and governance from the lens of the marginalized.The Advocacy Internship Program, for building capacities of youth, was launched in 1999. A meticulously formulated curriculum to understand the complexities of the Indian condition  its social fabric, economics and politics  both academically and in the context of socio-cultural realities, guided this program for preparing youth in the praxis of people-centered advocacy it produced around 100 young leaders who are working in various positions in organizations from academics, media, policy think tanks and civil society organisations from grassroots to international level. NCAS has conducted evidence-based research on various issues especially tribal land rights and has published knowledge materials that were very useful for students, researchers and activists.  NCAS has initiated certificate courses on public policy and advocacy reaching out to more and more Grant Application Form, July 1 20136professionals who are interested in Public Policy.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):The scenario of the contemporary socio-political environment mandates that more than management and consultancy skills, a studied approach towards social change shall prove to be more beneficial. In this light the National Center for Advocacy Studies (NCAS) will prove to be the perfect agent to advance both the requisites of the contemporary scenario:1.      Nurturing professional experts with an academic background for evidence-based advocacy2.

For the next five years NCAS plans to work on access to public services, health, food security, education, disaster management and climate change6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):With gaping problems consisting of threats to natural and human capital it was clear that any action by the formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has to be formulated to ensure protection and thriving of humanity and the Grant Application Form, July 1 20137environment. Seeking accountability from the system has now become the most challenging task for the civil society actors. The changing political scenario has tried hard to silence the voices from the margins, the current economic crisis in the country affects the marginalized communities the most, discrimination, and denial of social justice have become more pressing, giving a push to the civil society in the direction of people-centered and people-monitored advocacy for accountability of egalitarian State actions.One of the thematic, education is the one we have been focusing on in Maharashtra, the New Education Policy of 2020 which has now moved into the implementation phase, has been under heavy criticism while the policy seems to provide a wide range of opportunity for students, there is still a huge gap between the ground realities and the implementation plan. While one of the major challenges that has engulfed us is the pandemic, which has pushed some of the most vulnerable sections to the margins even further. Children have dropped out of school; loss of learning is one of the major concerns in this era where digital learning has taken over. A number of children have fallen in the cracks due to lack of opportunity. With the state wide networks and other civil society groups, there has been a constant effort to highlight the plight of these children by constantly engaging with the government agency to not overlook the ground realities, one of the major struggles is towards reopening of schools, the government is yet to take a clear stand on the same.   Demanding accountability from the government especially while accessing the right to food is yet another major problem especially in the remote tribal areas where access to services is still very low. The systems and structures that need to be in place to ensure that access to food is not hampered are also in a limbo, the vigilance committees formulated under Public Distribution System still continue to be either dysfunctional or have not been formulated. These committees play a key role from within the village to ensure quality control and equal distribution. However, the lack of these committees or the dysfunctional nature is due to the lack of will within the system to ensure transparency and accountability. NCAS has been engaged in creating awareness, enabling communities to seek accountability from the government in two districts, here the communities being close knit usually do not raise questions against their own members who are in position of power, thats a major hurdle. It is evident that malnutrition became a very serious concern hence seeking accountability for food security is a very key concern.In terms of opportunities- National and local networks are of a great support to amplify the issuesAt state lever there are still avenues for negotiation and dialogue with the government.Some of the major challenges is the ongoing pandemic that takes over all other issues and has slowed down negotiations. The current dispensation also leaves very little room for rights of people. In such a climate the only hope is to uphold the democratic rights given in the constitution of India.",

Given the unusual nature of the process, which might come in conflict with local vested interests, the overarching process of facilitation would aim at creating an enabling environment by seeking the support of influential local stakeholders in the process of change. The representatives of vulnerable communities coming forward to lead the process of change would be provided with relevant capacity building support from the cluster, in order that then can leverage the capabilities gained from the process to apply in other relevant domains, e.g in the area of local self-governance or in seeking accountability of various duty bearers and the state, in a process of people centered advocacy.

Issues pertaining to trafficking, Grant Application Form, July 1 201311migration, lack of access to basic services have made the communities very vulnerable. It is important that the organisations working with the community bring about a shift in their interactions with the community, due to the heightened risk of natural calamity the relief operations conducted by local organisations have also raised the expectations of the community from the organisaitons. Hence the narrative of charity, empowerment through skill development that increases employability should shift to making the communities self sustained, aware about their rights and that  seeks accountability on the services that the government provides to them. Participation of the community in decision making process of the Panchayat, increased participation of women in the panchayat, gram sabha etc. build capacities of their staff to acquire essential skills and perspective to anchor right based, community led, gender responsive program.10.

(300 words):iProbono is a global women and LGBT+ led social justice organisation with an active, UK based Board of five trustees including iProbonos founder, Shireen Irani. iProbono operates globally with a strong presence in South Asia. IProbono (India) Legal Services is registered as a s.8 company in India and the Indian and UK entities operate completely separately in relation to finance and governance, they are linked for branding purposes by an IP agreement. iProbonos UK-based CEO works closely with our UK Board to plan and ensure impactful delivery of our program strategy. Our CEO is supported by our Global Operations Director (also Chair of our India Board) and they ensure overall compliance and our local programs team are embedded in each of the countries we work in including in the UK, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. Team Directors, who are qualified lawyers supervise a team of legally trained Program Officers and Managers including two Justice Leila Seth Fellows in India and a team of social workers. Under the guidance of our Research and Impact Director, we enhance our monitoring and evaluation capacities to maximise learning and strengthen programs accountability and an India and South Asia Advisory Committee provide substantive guidance to programs.

In addition, highlight 2-3 key achievements.Please keep this brief and list up to 3 key achievements as bullet points. Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)Inspired by the belief that, at their best, lawyers are rights protectors and defenders who can unlock opportunities iProbono was established in 2009. We embedded our model locally in India and other South Asian jurisdictions striving to deliver our mission to ensure access to justice for all in pursuit of a just society.Core achievements:2023: iProbono India was awarded the Children Champions Award by the Delhi Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) in recognition of our work to ensure justice for all. More details here: https://i-probono.com/case-study/iprobono-wins-childrens-champions-award-2023/2018 to date: Our successful pilot Accelerate Program provides sub-grants t projects in India and Bangladesh. For example, in Assam, we provide funding and legal expertise to a group of lawyers to protect Oak Application Form     6citizenship rights of the most vulnerable people. Deliverables include: Direct litigation support before Foreigners Tribunals (FT) and Gauhati High Court; legal training and capacity building for lawyers and community members; awareness campaigns including social media, public events and door to door outreach. iProbono maintains an under the radar approach and a no visibility policy. This year we ensured the release of 5 people from detention centres, provided 33 clients with interim protection from arrest, contested 3 FT cases and filed 41 writ petitions to protect the citizenship rights of our clients.2019: iProbono hosted over 50 human rights defenders, lawyers, activists and storytellers working in South Asia at a closed Forum in Colombo Sri Lanka to Accelerate Inclusive Movements for Social Justice in the region. The aim was to discuss strategies for litigation and legal advocacy as well as change hearts and minds of the public on key thematic areas including citizenship rights and LGBT+ rights: decriminalisation of homosexuality and legislating for transgender communities. We maintained this group and achieved impact in these areas.5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Problem statement: Our work in South Asia over the past 10 years has shown us that despite sustained efforts by both government and civil society, access to justice in the current economic, social and political scenario in India remains extremely unequal. A two-tiered justice system allows only a privileged minority to understand the law and access justice. While state-led legal aid provisions and other legal recourse mechanisms do exist, not every marginalised community/individual (women, children, survivors of abuse, religious minorities, migrant workers and the disabled to name a few) has easy access to these mechanisms. Poor legal literacy and/or the lack of awareness of ones rights under the law further hinders any meaningful engagement with the justice system. As a result, legal representation remains beyond the reach of poor and vulnerable communities. We also note that grassroots organisations representing the interests of these vulnerable communities similarly suffer from a lack of quality and affordable legal advice. And finally, primary stakeholders within the justice system (for example, public prosecutors, the police, lawyers, and so on) often lack nuanced knowledge of the laws that serve to protect the rights of these communities.Theory of Change: iProbonos pathway to real change is based in a law and development paradigm that ensures the most vulnerable communities in our society have access to and a voice within the legal system. Our model of holistic counsel engages and combines a series of tools including litigation, direct legal advice, professional development, outreach and community education, research advocacy and policy, and capacity building. Storytelling Oak Application Form     7to change hearts and minds cross cuts across our tools and the concept of comprehensive care provides us with an additional tool to go one step beyond the legal. Alongside our capacity building and litigation support, we have also provided our partner organisations across India with emergency hunger relief funding during the Covid pandemic, or psychosocial support our clients who are survivors of sexual abuse in India or the ability to evacuate and support of 120 at risk women from Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in 2021.This holistic justice model thus aims to both prevent rights violations, seek solutions when violations have occurred, and catalyse deeper systemic change. With the Oak Foundations support, we intend to deepen our engagement in each of these areas with selected sub-grantees in West Bengal: 2 carefully selected partner organisations to deliver holistic access to justice to vulnerable communities in West Bengal.We have held an initial consultation with a core group of 8 organisations currently supported by the Oak Foundation to gain insight in to the type of access justice issues faced by communities. As part of the proposal, we have included an initial scoping period to allow our internal team to apply the stated theory of change in the selection of sub-grantee organisations as well as in the process of supporting these organisations to plan delivery.Diversity, equity and inclusion underpin our theory of change and an active internal Equality Law team advises on how we inform each of our programs from choice of delivery partner to thematic issues covered in our work. iProbono intends to monitor implementation in this area during the grant period.",

We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):We are acutely aware of the geo-political implications of delivering our programs in the face of shrinking civil society space. Beyond this we assess risk across the organisation and maintain a risk register which we review regularly with our board and funders where We are well networked with key players in the social justice field who support us to navigate and manage risk in the current environment.During discussions with the Oak Foundation team over the past 6 months, we discussed our risk strategy for maintaining a literal and theoretical separation between our UK and India entities. With the shift in climate for the non-profit sector in India and government clamp downs we maintain our decision not to register for FCRA and rely in India on local funding resource. The sub-granting model described in this proposal mitigates possible risks to our work in West Bengal and we will work closely with our partner organisation to keep up to date with any legal changes that may impact progress. We maintain a policy of low visibility and keeping certain programmatic achievements, impact and the names of our supporters carefully under the radar of any publicity or social media.We maintain a strict communications policy across teams and regularly train our in-house team on how to navigate the changing scenario in our region and beyond.",

Summarise the projects ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)The projects ultimate goal is to highlight child agency as one of the critical components that need to be kept in mind while amplifying community voices. The adult-child axis of power is a difficult power gradient to engage with by both adults and children. This becomes even more complicated in case of adolescents where issues about choice and consent assume very different nuances.Agency in children and adolescents is also strongly related to gender identity and expression and is shaped by gender norms and expectations. The project hopes to capacitate implementing organisations to acknowledge  agency of children and adolescents and appreciate the role that gender plays in hindering and facilitating participation of children and women so that their opinions and choices are reflected adequately within community voices and action.",

(maximum 300 words):The annual operating cost for the year 2020-21 was Rs. 2,27,46,956. This included approximately Rs. 40,00,000 which was received as Covid Relief Grants.Praajak currently depends on donor agency grants to finance more than 95% of its projects and is currently developing a sustainability plan by building reserves which it hopes to adopt by the end of 2021. Praajak has adopted a reserve policy in 2020 to streamline these concerns.6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Since 2015, Praajak has implemented its strategy for youth collectivization reaching out to approximately 3500 adolescents and youth.A series of dynamic gender and sexuality modules have been developed for young people and for use in meetings with adult mens and womens groups.  It has been adapted to work with boys who are vulnerable to coming into conflict with the law.Praajak continues the Annual Kabaddi Tournament with girls and women in the intervention communities, in collaboration with the State and District Kabaddi Associations. It continues to reinforce the learning in study circles by building skills on team work, leadership and assertiveness.Praajak hopes to reach out to more organisations so that to they are encouraged to develop programmes with boys and push for the adoption of a root cause approach to prevention of violence against children. It has also consolidated its relief and emergency support work in the context of Covid with nomadic and semi-nomadic populations The two Railway Childlines run by Praajak in Malda and Asansol are playing a critical role in supporting them6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Praajak is focusing on its DNA to move on to its mission and vision. This referred to Praajaks core competency in working with adolescents at the cusp of child protection and gender equity and its belief that adolescent and youth are best positioned to lead efforts for social and cultural transformation and shape a world of empathy, esteem and acceptance. Praajak felt the most validated as it worked to facilitate boys and girls to transform their worlds by transforming themselves first and fostered a network of vibrant community spaces that are designed and led by youth. These spaces were promoted as places for exploration, agency and behavioural change.The strategy that was adopted was called the 3C Model which referred to Grant Application Form, July 1 20136Collectives (collectivising adolescents), Community (advocating with and mobilising the community in favour of the rights of children and adolescents) and Campus (developing leadership programmes for young people so they can set up their own projects)6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):The problems we are addressing are chiefly around   understanding community led actions, is the meaning of effective participation and revisiting boundaries between the community and the organization. Simultaneously we are also looking at how the concept of child agency can be integrated into child rights/protection work and how by addressing masculinities related issues we can include boys and men as allies in our efforts to assume gender equity.Praajak believes that any capacity development should be built on the foundation of the existing strengths of trainees and make use of their experiences. This will mean any capacity building will use both experiential training and handholding during implementation as major methodologies.Communication and appropriate messaging have emerged as a major challenge for partner organization and there is a legacy of organisational interaction with stakeholders which needs to be tackled in a way that harm can be reduced for the organisations current operations.A comprehensive advocacy workshop emphasising needs to be conducted for all staff in one or more phases as is suitable to the organisation.The following areas will need to be addressed:The difference between advocacy on one hand and community mobilisation, public relations and IEC/BCC on the other.Formulation of SMART advocacy adjectivesStakeholder Analysis and MessagingA framework for organisational strategy regarding stakeholder communication.Additionally, a tool called the CCC-NERO will be introduced that will help to enhance the skills of social workers of partner organizations on the frontline.Child Marriage, Child Trafficking and Child Labour in terms of Root Causes, Identifying Vulnerabilities, Legislation Custody vs Agency, Response SystemsGender and Social Development- Concept of Gender, Gender Norms and Roles, Patriarchy, Gender based Discrimination and Violence, Gender EquityDocumentation-Understanding Narratives and Storytelling, Understanding Audience, Documentation Skills The overall recommendation is the following:1. Praajak will create a module (in Bangla, if that is convenient) for the above areas2. Praajak will use the module to organise a Training of Trainers (TOT) of senior officials. The trainers can then use the module and the experience of Grant Application Form, July 1 20137the training to further train their staff who work on the frontline.3.

The Board of Directors needs to attend Annual General Meetings conducted at least thrice every year according to the Memorandum of Association. The Board has no specific advisory board or committee. The overall management approach towards planning and implementing projects is one of managing various operations through a vertical division of Prathams programs. Our management structure is a hierarchical one led by our Board as well as the Chief Executive Officer. Thereafter, Regional/State Heads, Content & Training teams, Program Development teams, Monitoring & Evaluation Unit and Central Admin & Accounts team are incharge of program strategy and evaluation whereas the State and Implementation teams are incharge of the implementation of the project on the field. Frequent program reviews, training sessions as well as conferences ensure that the field teams are constantly in touch with the central teams so that the  implementation of the project on the ground happens in an efficient manner as originally envisioned and in case of any obstacles in implementation, intervention can happen immediately so that the potential impact of the project is not hampered in any manner.

Since then, the organization has grown both in scope & geographical coverage and has expanded to most parts of India reaching millions of children in both rural and urban areas across 20 states and 3 union territories.

Pratham Skilling is the vocational training arm of Pratham, established  in 2005 with the aim of empowering youth (age 18-35 years) from economically disadvantaged backgrounds by creating avenues for them to attain employability and/or entrepreneurship. Since 2005, we have trained 1,76,000+ youth in industry specific trades and placed 75-80% youth in jobs in automotive, hospitality, healthcare, electrical, beauty & construction trades among our 2000+ industry partners at our 130+ centers spread across 16 states. We also run entrepreneurship development projects and have supported 5,300+ entrepreneurs.The following are some of Prathams key achievements:1.Blended learning approach: Effective blended learning project in 1000 communities since 2016. 8000 tablets and 1000 Raspberry Pis distributed, impacting 60,000 children and 6000 youth, including 2000 drop-outs.2.Hybrid Skilling Innovation: Pratham pivoted to a remote-contact self-learning and virtual-training model in 20,000+ villages during the lockdown leading to employment for 32,000+ youth from Oct 2020-March 2022.3.Post-Placement Tracking: To ensure continued retention in employment, Pratham reaches out to each trainee every 3 months, for a period of 1 year, collecting 110+ data points tracking their employment status and need for further placement assistance.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):The communities of North Bengal live in precarious conditions, highly dependent on employment provided by tea-plantation owners. Low wages, seasonal employment cycle, plantation owners restrictions and lack of alternative income-earning opportunities are some of the key challenges faced by these communities. To understand the region in more detail, a team of 4 Pratham members, including program leadership visited Soongachi, Naxalbari, Kakarvita & Cooch Behar tea estates in March 2022. The team interacted with the sarpanch & gram-panchayat members and conducted 3 focused group discussions with the youth & their parents on their current employment situation, aspirations and challenges. Most of the youth majorly belonged to SC/ST sections with someone from their family working in a tea garden. Some key insights from their discussions:1. Current Employment Status: While some youth were still studying, majority of them had completed their 12th and graduation and were not engaged in any employment activity. 2. Aspiration: The youth showed disinterest towards working in tea-gardens and were looking for other job opportunities. However, they lacked exposure about jobs available in different sectors, how to access them and industry requirements. There was a clear need for guidance and mentorship for these youth. 3. Willingness to migrate for training & job: Majority of these youth showed willingness to join a vocational training course near their communities and migrate for a job opportunity within Bengal. Hospitality, Automotive 4W, Healthcare and electrical trades were some of the most chosen preferences of these youth. 4. Workforce demand: The tea-gardens being a tourist attraction, there is massive demand for hospitality staff. Interaction with a couple of automotive showrooms and service dealerships and resorts reflected the need for skilled staff within this region. Year 2 onwards electrical trade will also be introduced based on a need assessment study conducted with industry partners.  Another interaction with Adivasi Vikas Parishad and SPAN NGO further emphasized livelihood related challenges, trafficking issues, mobility and connectivity problems, education and healthcare related issues within the region. While these interactions clearly indicate lack of awareness on vocational training led employment pathways, Pratham will conduct a detailed need assessment survey both in the community and with industry partners in North Bengal to understand aspirations and needs in greater depth. The survey will also capture potential job opportunities within tea manufacturing units. Insights from this detailed survey will feed into the program design.  Oak Application Form     9Based on Prathams experience of 17 years training over 1,75,000 rural youth across India, we propose  a  community-focused youth training initiative in Hospitality and Automotive 4W trades in Year 1 and Electrical trade in Year 2 of the engagement with the youth. Following are the key components of the programs: Building Awareness : Mentors will interact with youth, panchayat and community leaders spreading awareness on career pathways through vocational training focusing primarily on communities working in the tea garden areas of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar, Uttar Dinajpur and Dakshin Dinajpur districts of North Bengal region. Group meetings, skill-melas, video testimonials of Prathams alumni will be leveraged to build awareness. At this stage, youth will be enrolled in Level 1 -7-day long self-placed digital courses giving exposure to 7 different industry trades and potential job opportunities within them. Training  Conducted in a hybrid approach, the core training includes two components namely, Level 2 (virtual sessions) and Level 3 (in-person practical sessions). The entire training spans roughly 45-60 days. Job Placements- Trained youth will be oriented with available job opportunities within Hospitality and Automotive sectors. Pratham negotiates with its placement partners for salaries and additional benefits- food, accommodation and transportation allowance for its trainees. Youth will be guided throughout the interview and joining process. Post-Placement Tracking: To ensure continued retention in employment, Pratham reaches out to each trainee every 3 months, for a period of 1 year, collecting 110+ data points tracking their employment status and need for further placement assistance.",

If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):Oak Application Form     14Pratham engages with multiple stakeholders within the community and industry in all its programs. The success of the program is a collaborative effort between all stakeholders including Prathams team at all levels. For the proposed vocational training program, Pratham will be engaging with the following stakeholders over the course of the program period:Community members: Prathams mentor leaders consistently engage with community members, including the Sarpanch, local influencers, households and youth groups spreading awareness of vocational training programs.Industry partners: Prathams placement team engages with its strong network of 2000+ placement partners spread across the country. For the purpose of this project, new placement partners in the northeast region will be explored and partnered with for placements of youth trained through the program.Local NGOs/groups: Mentor leaders also engage with local NGOs and groups periodically to explore mutual interests in terms of spreading awareness on vocational skilling and leveraging each other's community presence.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING This section is twofold. Please tell us:a) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):Measurement is an integral part of all Pratham programs. Be it internal measurement, or external evaluations such as by government assessment agencies and industry sector bodies, Pratham has established a strong culture of capturing and using data rigorously to demonstrate impact over the past several years.In 2013, Pratham set up a separate Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation (MME) Unit to be able to systematically carry out a set of planned evaluations to measure and track progress and impact.  This evidence is now internally analyzed to understand the strengths and shortcomings of Prathams programs, and to assist in developing solutions to improve the effectiveness of the programs.A key measure of our impact is the number of youth trained that retain jobs beyond 6 months  this is a measure we have adopted above and beyond the standard metrics of training and placement that are the norms for the sector. We are also trying to use the insights from our measurement of impact to get a similar measurement adopted by the entire ecosystem.Currently, Pratham gathers both quantitative and qualitative information about all students enrolled at the training center. At each of the centers, Oak Application Form     15concerned staff will gather extensive background details such as family income, educational qualifications and fee status of each student which will then be compiled in the Salesforce Management Information System (MIS). The reports generated will include both Quantitative Metrics (such as the number of students enrolled, trained, certified, and supported as entrepreneurs, as well as retention and dropout rates) and Qualitative Data about the social and economic impact of our programs (e.g. through student case studies). Entrepreneurs are also tracked on a monthly basis once supported, for the period of a year, to better understand their progress and any challenges faced. The Central Team provides them with ongoing support and mentorship during this period.Data Checks through Internal Dashboard: Pratham uses Salesforce to capture all center & student level data. Pratham has developed centralized monitoring and reviewing through an advanced dashboard (on Salesforce) to monitor progress of the centers. This helps us to monitor the data at the micro level and take actions as required. Pratham has developed an independent audit team responsible for planned and impromptu audits at the center level. They are responsible for overall quality check with a comprehensive checklist and feedback mechanism. Supporters are also encouraged to visit the Centers they sponsor and assess the impact their investment is having through this transformative educational and vocational training program.Daily monitoring process at centers: Regularized monitoring - The rationale is to get an understanding about the daily processes and activities occurring at the center. Through this we aim to collect data that represents staff attendance, center photographs, students mobilization, expense details, etc.All programs will be tracked throughout the year and an annual report will be submitted at the end of every year. Pratham will also share reports along with case studies, videos and photographs. We are now planning to use apps to get information from centers, feedback from students, etc on a regular basis to ensure better quality and checks. The center heads are required to fill the data like no. of students present, no. of staff present with an option to upload live pictures on a daily basis. Given that this will be our first project in the far north-east part of the country, we will leverage this opportunity to learn in-depth about youth from this region. We would like to learn about the aspirations of these youth and explore the need for starting new vocational training programs/ entrepreneurship models suited specifically for this region. Periodic surveys and focused group discussions will be conducted to understand the target group of youth in greater depth.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESOak Application Form     16What are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):The project may entail the following risks.1.Timeline: Project may not be implemented as per timeline/schedule mentioned in the MoU due to operational challenges, unexpected holidays, local festivals, Government elections, environmental stresses.Mitigation steps: Pratham will deploy monitoring checks at the center, state and central level at regular intervals to ensure that the proposed implementation timeline is adhered to. The teams are committed to complete the project on time as per the schedule of activities mentioned in the MoU.2.Operational Risks: Pratham could face challenges in terms of mobilization due to lack of willingness of rural youth to join employment or their families to allow them to seek employment. Challenges could arise from resistance of employers to provide employment or food & accommodation to trainees under an on-site model. Trainees could also dropout from course mid training or not opt for job post training due to personal or family problems.Mitigation steps:  Mobilization: Pratham will work towards creating awareness about the program through digital content to educate the community and youth about the intricacies and realities of the program in order to augment mobilization efforts.Employer Support: Pratham will consistently engage with placement partners by inviting them for interviews, and guest lectures at the residential training centres or through virtual sessions to convince them on Prathams pedagogy of teaching and training model. This will enable the placement partners to understand the quality of training provided and the skills of the trainees, thereby getting their buy-in to come on board for the onsite model.Drop-Out: With an on-site model, there is daily interaction through virtual classes with the Pratham team, in-person interaction during counseling sessions conducted weekly/fortnightly. Trainees are also personally attended to in case of any issues or difficulties they come across during the training.",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONSPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak programme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. Oak Application Form     17a. What are the systemic level changes that may be achieved in the long run? The programme needs to evolve from a service delivery mode to a more systemic change mode that will position the programme as a replicable and scalable model for adoption in the skilling landscape in India.On a national level, India has taken a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) approach to fulfill the skill development mission in partnership with industry sectors. The PPP model offers the public sector potential cost, quality and scale advantages in achieving service targets.Since inception in 2015, Prathams delivery model of community mobilization, residential training at the center with industry vetted curriculum and job placement as an end outcome has scaled from 1 to 130 centers across 15 states in India. Since the pandemic, Pratham has pivoted to a hybrid skilling model integrating familiar technology and tracking systems to provide skill training and help youth sustain in employment.The reach and scale has become 3xmore than what was possible through door-to-door physical mobilization. In tandem with the national approach excluding public entity involvement at the delivery stage, Pratham leverages its strong community engagement initiatives making the model sustainable in the long-run.The hybrid skilling model can be easily replicated through capacity building of teams on digital tools & data-driven approaches.Can you please try to elaborate on the benefits for the community and how the programme can be positioned in the donor landscape for generating more funding traction?The skilling program of Pratham is currently aligned with Goal 8 of SDGs. The Skilling program not only imparts vocational skills to the youth but also has multifold impact on the entire community. To begin with the direct beneficiary, the youth themselves receive an holistic education when ongoing training (including life skills, financial literacy, and many more). This prepares them for the outside world learning to manage themselves away from the family. As our model demands them to stay out of home for a certain period of time this allows them to become more confident about themselves.Necessary awareness of other available employment opportunities will help provide direction with regard to proper skilling of the youth in reference to their profession of choice. Financial literacy skills (inculcated within the skilling programs) will help foster fiscally sound decisions with regard to their money. Moreover, financial literacy has a significant impact on families as this knowledge helps balance family budgets, ensuring proper utilization of funds for household necessities, health insurance, childrens education, retirement etc.Seeing this, the community is encouraged to send more youth to such programs.Pratham evolved its approach of training when the pandemic hit. From a residential model Pratham moved to a hybrid model using the center, community spaces and placement partner properties as a space for practical training. This enabled Pratham to enter communities and Oak Application Form     18interact with the people directly. This shift in strategy allowed Pratham to reach out to more villages and increase its presence.As most of the funding is received from CSRs and Foundations with an objective to promote livelihood and sustainable economic growth, the Pratham skilling model ensures visible indicators of impact, focussing on employability status, income generation and industry absorption. As most of Prathams work focuses on skilling of youth these programs allow interaction with organizations in a capacity of volunteering and employee engagement. Direct interaction through motivational speeches, life skills, work ethics, etiquette, interview preparations are possible in this model. b. There is a scope to align the cross-sectoral impact of this programme on reducing instances of unsafe/distress migration and trafficking, education attainment and collectivization of youth. These may therefore be further elaborated with clear objectives which can uniquely position the programme as a skilling programme with multi-dimensional impact.  You can try to include this as one of the project objectives and state the collaboration that can be attained with the other Oak grantees working in the North Bengal tea garden space. Prathams model of skilling not only imparts vocational skills to the youth but also has multifold impact on the entire community.1.Alternative income source: Additional income inflow into families through youth taking up formal jobs will help improve the overall standard of living of these communities, aiding in better healthcare facilities  and schooling opportunities for children.2.Counseling support: Physical presence of a training center will serve as a hub for all kinds of information support for skilling and employment opportunities. The team will  be instrumental in counseling youth and young children towards available career pathways and help mitigate trafficking activities in the vicinity.3.Boost to local economy: Youth who wish to opt for self-employment will be guided to start their own enterprises.4.Financial Literacy: Imparted to youth during the skilling programs will help foster fiscally sound decisions with regard to their money. Such knowledge will help balance family budgets, ensuring proper utilization of funds for household necessities, health insurance, childrens education, retirement etc.5.Building youth community volunteers: A unique Education for Education model will be linked to the vocational training program for the youth. The intent is to make the youth a key stakeholder in the learning curve of children of the community. In exchange for the vocational training modules, youth will be trained to deliver short interventions for the children of the community to build and enhance their basic foundational skills of reading and arithmetic. Oak Application Form     19     c. Since the vocational training programme will be launched in a new geography, it will be good to document the evolution (programme launch, challenges, opportunities and risks and success) of past training programmes in similar geographies characterized by skills gaps, location remoteness and technological limitations. Have such programmes yielded positive results? If so, what have been the contributing factors?  Can you therefore state the experience of Pratham in launching such programmes in new geography and the overall experience and the successes/challenges? Every geography represents a unique culture and has its own advantages and constraints. Pratham has always adopted an inclusive approach, tailoring the model based on the needs of a specific region. Prathams vocational training initiatives in Gadchiroli, a tribal region in Maharashtra started in 2012 in collaboration with the forest and police departments. An inclusive counseling approach and facilitation of transportation for tribal youth to training centers in Maharashtra helped increase receptiveness among the tribal population. 5000+ youth have been trained so far from Gadchiroli in hospitality, construction and automotive trades who went on to pursue formal entry-level jobs post training. This approach was also recognized through the PMs award for public administration awarded to District Administration for the innovative partnership with Civil Society.Some factors that are unique to Prathams model and have been successful  across different states in India have been illustrated below: 1.Strong Community Engagement: Prathams mentors ( community mobilizers) engage extensively with all community stakeholders- sarpanch, self-help groups, community leaders and households on a regular basis. Community meetings, fairs, rallies, learning activities with children are some of the mediums through which members of the community are engaged and informed about Prathams education and skilling interventions. Together with the education programs, Prathams presence is spread across 20,000 communities in 17 states across the country. Pratham has built strong volunteer networks within these communities who form an integral part of the intervention and help sustain the initiatives in the long-run.2.Detailed Need Assessment Survey: Pratham conducts needs assessment surveys within the community and with industry partners of the region before initiating a new program. The survey helps understand the demographic profile and  aspirations of youth in greater depth along with industry demand for different job roles in the region. This helps in designing the program and adopt an inclusive approach considering region specific challenges. The team also visits and interacts with local stakeholders and organizations working in the region to understand the local context in more depth.3.Counseling : Prathams experience over the past decade has re-affirmed the importance of counseling time and again- not only of the skilling aspirant but of his/her family and the community in general in Oak Application Form     20the entire skilling value chain. The process of counseling is therefore deeply embedded at every step of the skill training, placement and alumni engagement levels. There are different stakeholders involved at each level and the nature and approach is customized to suit the need of the time. Overall, 10 hours worth of counseling is done beginning from mobilization, training and placement. Alumni engagement involves periodic contact with the graduates with the frequency varying based on the need of the hour in addition to the structured group events held at each location.4.Practical Hands-on Training: 15 days of the Level 3 course module is based on practical training which offers a unique opportunity for youth to learn real-life application of trade specific skills. This helps trainees get a first-hand experience of a work-place scenario helping them transition smoothly into formal work environments as soon as they graduate.5.Content Innovation: Pratham has digitized all its training content and reading material and uploaded the entire package on Pratham Open School Platform for ease of accessibility by trainees. Youth can visit the site and refer to the content at all times. Further, Prathams trainers themselves have created interesting videos taking inspiration from real-life situations which are uploaded on the open school site and shared with trainees as well. These help to create more relatable experience for youth helping them grasp technical knowledge faster.6.Data-driven systems: Every program is designed based on evidence from data and decision-making at every step is highly data-driven.Challenges:The project may entail the following risks.1.Timeline: Project may not be implemented as per timeline/schedule mentioned in the MoU due to operational challenges, unexpected holidays, local festivals, Government elections, environmental stresses.Mitigation steps:Pratham will deploy monitoring checks at the center, state and central level at regular intervals to ensure that the proposed implementation timeline is adhered to. The teams are committed to complete the project on time as per the schedule of activities mentioned in the MoU.2.Operational Risks: Pratham could face challenges in terms of mobilization due to lack of willingness of rural youth to join employment or their families to allow them to seek employment. Challenges could arise from resistance of employers to provide employment or food & accommodation to trainees under an on-site model. Trainees could also dropout from course mid training or not opt for job post training due to personal or family problems.Mitigation steps:  Mobilization: Pratham will work towards creating awareness about the program through digital content to educate the community and youth about the intricacies and realities of the program in order to augment mobilization efforts.Oak Application Form     21Employer Support: Pratham will consistently engage with placement partners by inviting them for interviews, and guest lectures at the residential training centers or through virtual sessions to convince them on Prathams pedagogy of teaching and training model. This will enable the placement partners to understand the quality of training provided and the skills of the trainees, thereby getting their buy-in to come on board for the onsite model.Drop-Out: With an on-site model, there is daily interaction through virtual classes with the Pratham team, in-person interaction during counseling sessions conducted weekly/fortnightly. Trainees are also personally attended to in case of any issues or difficulties they come across during the training.  d. The possibility of increasing the co-funding during the course of the programme. Since there is an increasing amount of funding that is being directed to skilling programmes in India, there should be a clear goal in generating more interest among other donors for funding the skilling programme for youth of the tea gardens.  Can you state (the source may not be mentioned immediately, if not decided) on how Pratham intends to leverage co-funding for this programme and also state any avenues which may be explored jointly by Oak and Pratham to generate funding availability for the skilling programmes? Pratham is expanding presence in the Eastern part of India. Pratham actively approaches existing and new CSRs and Foundations for expansion in newer regions. With the support of Oak, Pratham skilling will be able to show presence in the tea garden belt attracting the current and the new CSRs to support programs in this specific belt.Usually when ventured into a new geography, Pratham announces its expansion to donors via emails, newsletters, referrals, social media posts, further application for proposals, etc. This usually generates interest in donors fleshing out to a partnership.Pratham also plans to leverage on the existing networks of Oak with other non-profits or funding organizations to expand the scope of funding. This will allow Pratham to expand its network and create financial or knowledge based partnerships as required.     Oak Application Form     22",

Nazdeeks organisational budget for 2020-2021 is $250,000, including grants from various funders since: Amplify Change, in partnership with Swadhikar- May 1, 2016Every Mother Counts (core funding)- May 15, 2014 Laudes Foundation- January 1, 2021 Namati- November 15, 2020 The Fund for Global Human Rights (core and project funding)- May 29, 2014 These funders have made long-term commitments to legal empowerment work, and have aided in strengthening Nazdeek. We also receive approximately  $15,000-20,000 annually through individual donations towards programs. Fundraising strategy:Our fundraising needs are identified based on Nazdeeks organisational vision and mission, and an annual strategic assessment of organisational priorities, combined with community, partner organization, and paralegal needs. While no one staff member is dedicated to fundraising, all co-founders, board members, and staff members play a key role in fundraising, including identifying potential donors and writing and pitching proposals.We are occasionally forwarded opportunities by our existing funders. We approach individual donors through fundraising campaigns to account for contingencies. Reserve Funds and Debts: Nazdeeks current reserve is approximately $75,000 and there are no outstanding debts. Expected Changes: The Oak Foundation Grant will enhance our organisational budget significantly, enabling us to realise our vision of introducing our model to other Indian states; undertaking national-level policy advocacy; elevating FRTW from an Indian to an international coalition; and expanding our team. These goals align with the objectives and strategies in our grant proposal. Nazdeeks organisation budget is expected to reach $715,000 by the end of 2024 due to expanded support from one of our current funders and being in an advanced stage of a long-term funding application process.NOTE: The proposed project will be undertaken in partnership with host organisation/s. Grant Application Form, July 1 201376c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Nazdeek has successfully worked towards bringing access to justice closer to marginalised communities across South Asia. Since 2012, working closely with Adivasi worker communities, we have conducted numerous trainings to expand workers knowledge of socio-economic, labour, and maternal health rights. Our training aided activists in their fight for a higher minimum wage for tea plantation workers, securing a historic 77% increase in daily wages for 800,000 tea plantation workers in Assam. Following our efforts providing training, conducting community meetings, and advocating for workers, the Assam governments Minimum Wage Advisory Committee recommended another wage increase of 110% (from Rs. 167 to Rs. 351) in 2018.Evidence from our human rights fact-finding investigations and monitoring, such as EndMMNow, supported successful filing of complaints by workers to secure their rightful food, health, housing, and labour benefits. Nazdeek also amplified community voices nationally and globally through published reports: No Time to Lose: Fighting Maternal and Infant Mortality through Community Reporting (2015), A Matter of Life and Death: Surviving Childbirth on Assams Tea Plantations (2018), Hidden Traumas: Uncovering Experiences of Obstetric Violence (2020), and Rising Stronger: Security Strategies for Women Defenders (2020). Our research in Assam and greater South Asia was also critical in our founding of the FRTW in 2019, a first of its kind forum for advancing the rights of tea plantation workers. In Delhi, working with 6 socio-economically marginalised communities, Nazdeeks 35 presently-active paralegal volunteers have ensured basic entitlements such as community clinics and Anganwadi Centers, and housing, water and sanitation rights for over 15,000 residents. Since 2020, Nazdeek and partners have provided COVID-19 humanitarian relief to over 25,000 individuals in Assam, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu. Nazdeeks work was recognised with the Namati Grassroots Justice Prize in 2015 and World Justice Prize in 2019.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Nazdeeks legal empowerment model places the communities we work with at the center of our work. We aspire to build leadership among women for greater participation in decision-making at the community, state, and policy-making levels. Nazdeeks sustainability strategy creates an advocacy and outreach model owned by the community, which thrives without our presence. Strategy:1. Identifying communities after detailed scoping, assessment, and needs-Grant Application Form, July 1 20138mapping. Through community meetings and partnerships with local organizations, we explain our model and invite participants for trainings. We prioritize outreach in communities marginalised on the basis of social identities like caste, class, religion, migration, and work status. 2. Training participants, predominantly women, to be community paralegals and equipping them with administrative and judicial tools for addressing rights violations. Using participatory methods, we ensure inclusive and safe training spaces for participants. 3. Assisting paralegals in using grievance redressal, policy advocacy, and strategic litigation tools. 4. At every stage, paralegals and communities decide their priorities and initiatives. We assess risks and identify mitigation strategies collectively, prioritising their safety and security. 5. Eventually, paralegals undertake community meetings independently, strengthening their human rights documentation and advocacy skills. Nazdeek then moves to an advisory role. 6. To support the long-term work of paralegals and connect community action to regional initiatives, we facilitate formation of coalitions. 7. Paralegals work on a voluntary basis and are not paid an honorarium. This aligns with Nazdeeks objective of building community leadership, agency,  and ownership of initiatives. Nazdeek does provide them certificates and supports them by sharing opportunities, relevant government schemes, and needs-based communications reimbursements.Since early 2020, due to the pandemic, we have employed several tools to continue engagement remotely. While we prioritise in-person visits, we have now developed novel modes of outreach and maintained our strategy despite the crisis. 6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):Tea plantation workers across South Asia experience dismal living and working conditions, earn meagre wages, and face ineffectual labour law protections. In India, where tea plantation workers are predominantly Adivasi (indigenous) and women, these conditions have led to an intergenerational cycle of oppression and poverty. Key issues faced: Currently, corporations function in the roles previously held by colonial powers, and are primarily responsible for the poor housing, wages, health care, food, water, and sanitation experienced by tea plantation workers. Workers are not paid a legal minimum wage, sufficient to ensure basic necessities for themselves and their families. Women do not receive sufficient medical care, especially pre- and post-natal maternal healthcare, leading to extremely high rates of anaemia, and high Grant Application Form, July 1 20139maternal and infant mortality on tea plantations.Nazdeek, with its partner organizations, has aided workers in addressing these problems and issues. However, recent circumstances have worsened this situation. Challenges: Due to the current political situation in India, organisations and individuals doing cutting edge rights work face a higher risk of coercive actions. Plantations have become inaccessible due to greater surveillance by their management. While the pandemic has opened up new ways of communicating for the rest of the world, our project communities have very limited access to electricity, gadgets, and the internet. The Central government has repealed and replaced 29 previous national labour laws with just 4 labour codes. While the previous laws did not provide robust worker protections, certain laws such as the Plantations Labour Act, did ensure specific protections for workers on tea plantations. Employers have taken advantage of the current legal ambiguities, wherein old laws have been repealed, but the new laws are not yet in force, further limiting the rights of workers on tea plantations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an even more dire situation for tea workers, as the pandemic-induced lockdown has created food scarcity as government-run ration shops and health centers remain closed or under-operational. Conversely, tea workers continue to be forced to work despite the pandemic and minimal safeguards on plantations. Opportunities: Addressing both the long-standing issues experienced by tea plantation workers and the new issues created by the pandemic is a struggle in the current legal and policy climate. However, this also makes it an increasingly important time to mobilize workers and assist them in their advocacy, as workers have the opportunity to comment on proposed laws and shape local policy in an effort to strengthen their legal rights. To overcome communication challenges, Nazdeek, its paralegals, and communities are adopting innovative methods. For example, we recently conducted 12 intensive online training sessions on labour laws with tea workers in Assam. With Central and State governments currently drafting rules to the labour laws, an opportunity has arisen for tea workers to engage in this process and to effect policy and legislative change. Nazdeek has therefore been facilitating their participation through trainings, consultations, and FRTW, resulting in submission of 5 comments to draft rules. This has allowed wider stakeholder representation, and workers have gained confidence to engage in similar processes in the future. Due to the aforementioned threats, now is a critical time for tea plantation workers advocacy. Enhancing their advocacy skills will not only address the immediate needs, but will also shape the future of tea workers rights. Legislative and policy changes now will combat negative effects of Indias new labour laws, as workers will have stronger legal protections and better avenues for demanding adequate wages, maternal health benefits, and improved living and working conditions.Grant Application Form, July 1 201310",

        "8. COOPERATION": "8. CooperationDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks and explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 words):Nazdeek strongly believes in collaborative work and collective action. To this end, Nazdeek has significant and longstanding partnerships with several community organizations, movements, and coalitions in Assam and other tea-growing states of India (including West Bengal). These groups include tea plantation workers, unions and union representatives, Adivasi community members, and activists, such as: An Adivasi women tea plantation workers collective, whose members have been trained by Nazdeek on socio-economic and labour rights since 7.5.b. Objective 5 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Outcomes (timeframe: 3 years)a. Increased collaboration, culminating in a national-level rights and advocacy strategy for Indian tea workers representatives, organisations, collectives, movements, and unions, thereby strengthening their collective voice and tea workers representation at the national level.b. Increased engagement, collaboration and knowledge sharing between tea workers representatives, organisations, collectives, movements and unions at an international level.Grant Application Form, July 1 2013152017. Furthermore, Nazdeek has supported the collective in advocating before government officials to bring awareness about rights violations and ensure grievance redressal. Promotion and Advancement of Justice, Harmony and Rights of Adivasis (PAJHRA) is a community-based, Adivasi-led organization based in Assam. PAJHRA promotes the rights of the Adivasi community, and frequently partners with Nazdeek in their advocacy. Nazdeek also collaborates with and provides technical support to civil society groups and unions based in West Bengal, especially through FRTW. FRTW, which Nazdeek facilitated the founding of, is also a crucial partner for this project. FRTW members will be the main leaders of national-level advocacy, as they will directly engage with workers collectives, unions, movements, and government bodies. Nazdeek also collaborates and partners with international CSOs, coalitions, and advocacy groups, and has various technological support partners. By working with these organizations, Nazdeek has gained greater insight into the specific needs and priorities of workers on tea plantations, which has shaped Nazdeeks training and advocacy work in this sector. These partnerships remain critical to our proposed goals, as these organizations and their members will be the ones shaping the course of our legal empowerment training and advocacy around the new labour laws.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. ImpactWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum 300 words):The key changes and results we want to see from this project include: Tea plantation workers in Assam are paid Rs.525 (current demand) daily wage with improved working and living conditions. Significant reduction in maternal and infant deaths on the plantation due to preventable causes or lack of services. Tea plantation workers have the knowledge and support to demand and access their socio-economic rights. Tea plantation workers actively participate in the rulemaking process both at the national and state levels, and have in-depth understanding of proposed laws and their demands. Tea plantation workers ensure state accountability towards the implementation of their laws and policies with a robust and responsive grievance redressal mechanism. Tea plantation workers are able to hold companies accountable for labour Grant Application Form, July 1 201316law violations, thereby ensuring rights of workers. Further expansion of Nazdeeks strategic work in other major tea growing regions of India to build capacity of stakeholders on the changed labour law regime.Strengthened national level movement of tea plantation workers for cross learning, collaboration, and to have a consolidated voice. Tea plantation workers in India have faced increased threats to their socio-economic rights. The changing labour law landscape has weakened the rights previously granted to tea workers, and the COVID-19 pandemic has created food and health crises on the plantations. We aim to strengthen the capacity of tea plantation workers to advocate for their rights, and thereby ensure access to these rights. 10. EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):Nazdeek will undertake two kinds of monitoring and evaluation exercises during the course of this project: A. Ongoing monitoring of our project indicators during the project period, which will include: a. Post-session evaluations of our training programs and other relevant activities, using tools such as surveys and feedback mechanisms. Based on the feedback, we will revise future training and activities, in order to best serve project beneficiaries and achieve the most impact. b. Through activity-based indicators, we will undertake continuous project assessment. Team-level monitoring will take place through regular team assessments, meetings and updates, during the course of the project.c. Reliance on a monitoring tool to assess progress of socio-economic rights in our partner communities. We are currently working with a partner organization for developing this tool. This tool will indicate the effectiveness of our strategies in achieving the project goals. B. A formalised, external and independent Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) exercise, to be undertaken with an expert consultant at the end of Year 1 as a preliminary analysis, and final M&E report within 6 months of the final conclusion of the project. These M&E exercises will assess:  a. Implementation of the project plan and programmes. Grant Application Form, July 1 201317b. Assessment of access to socio-economic rights for our partner communities. As mentioned above, this will indicate overall project effectiveness.",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future PlansHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum 300 words):For over a decade, Nazdeek has been a key partner to workers collectives and CSOs in the rights movements of tea plantation workers in India. The four new labour codes, and related rules and policies, will have long-lasting effects on the rights of tea plantation workers. Nazdeek intends to continue working with organizations in Assam and replicate its legal empowerment model in West Bengal, and across India through FRTW. This grant opportunity will enable Nazdeek and our partners to affect the drafting and implementation of these new laws across states. This will have a positive impact on workers rights in the future. This grant will ensure that the communities Nazdeek works with will be in the best position to defend their rights, as they will have developed the skill sets necessary to advocate for themselves and will have strong legal protections on which to rely. Aside from Nazdeeks significant advocacy work in India, we have also conducted scoping assessments of the rights of tea plantation workers in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Nazdeek is dedicated to supporting tea plantation workers in their advocacy, and it is critical that workers are organized at the national, regional, and international levels to ensure that the industry does not move from one state or country with stronger labour policies to another state or country with weaker ones. A regional or international coalition and movement focused on protecting the socio-economic and labour rights of tea workers is necessary to accomplish this. Nazdeek plans to continue our work in strengthening and expanding the FRTW, to conduct national, regional and international advocacy. This grant would allow Nazdeek to make significant progress in developing this Forum, and further, will bring Nazdeek closer to our goal of ultimately supporting a strong, international FRTW.Grant Application Form, July 1 201318Additionally, as Nazdeek scales up its legal empowerment model, we are also keen to further build our consultant's capacity and professional training on international complaints mechanisms, cross-country/regional learnings on grassroots empowerment models, subject area expertise, workflow management, psychosocial issues and stress management. We hope that the proposed grant will assist in achieving this goal as well.",

Its area of work has expanded from primarily energy related projects in 2005, to a wide variety, including climate resilience, water, waste, urban mobility, urban biodiversity, knowledge brokering, gender and environment, among others. 2.    ICLEI South Asia is empanelled with the National Water Mission of Ministry of Jal Shakti as a field agency to undertake work on water conservation, minimizing wastage and increasing water use efficiency through awareness and capacity building, encouraging local planning and participation. ICLEI South Asia is also an empanelled consultant for the Government of Indias other flagship programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission (national government empanelled consultants and state level committee member and facilitator in Rajasthan), Smart Cities Mission (empanelled consultant in 5 states) and HRIDAY Scheme (empanelled city anchor in 3 cities). 3.    ICLEI South Asia has developed and implemented replicable, adaptive local government specific tools that can be implemented collaboratively by local governments and communities. In project cities, ICLEI forms stakeholder groups of local NGOs, community representatives, private sector, institutions, etc for better community participation in local governance, and these groups continue their function beyond the project lives.  5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):There is intense research on the pressing challenge of access to water and sanitation for tea estate workers and their families in Darjeeling and Kurseong. The situation is also aggravated due to climate change. Climate impacts of decreased rainfall and increased temperatures in the northern part of West Bengal are well recorded in the Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment (INCCA), 2010 and the West Bengal State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), 2017. Both reports suggest a decrease in overall rainy days and an increase of minimum and maximum temperatures for the region. Such changes are not conducive for tea cultivation, and has resulted in increased dependency on local water reserves, natural streams and reservoirs. A Central Ground Water Board report from 2014 and a study by Rai et al., 2016 suggest natural springs and their watersheds are inefficiently managed and facing degradation. Excessive extraction, coupled with limited recharge or rejuvenation of natural reserves is leading to scarcity of water. The scarce resource is also subject to degradation through extensive use of Oak Application Form     7fertilizer, pesticides, and agrochemicals by the tea gardens and indiscriminate disposal of waste along the mountain slopes and often into the streams. Since some sources of water are available seasonally, there is greater likelihood of them being degraded during the dry spells. Apart from quality and quantity, reliable access to water is challenging as well, with tea estates, hotels promoting tea tourism, the managerial staff of tea estates, tea estate workers and local indigenous communities outside the tea estates all competing for the same scarce resource.  Even though it is evident that the tea estates play a pivotal role as major stakeholders in the water resources of the region, there appears to be a noticeable lack of engagement between the tea estates and the ongoing initiatives of the government. This discrepancy underscores the critical importance of collaboration among different stakeholders. There are a number of schemes of the West Bengal government that are looking at access to water, such as the Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo scheme, the Jaltirtho schemes that are supporting micro-irrigation technologies, as well as water harvesting or storage structures. Some development schemes such as the Kanyashree, Lakshmi Bhandar or Chai Sundari schemes look at housing, education or general social development. The current budget has allocated INR 823 crores for North Bengal development and more than INR 1500 crores for water resources development for the fiscal year 2023-24. In addition, more than INR 1300 crores have been allocated to technical training and skill development.More often than not, access to water is subject to an unwritten hierarchy wherein the indigenous community and the tea estate workers are at the bottom rung. Time and labour-intensive practice of fetching water from faraway places, impacts women in particular from these communities. There are reports indicating that consumption of poor quality water or inadequate water has impacted overall health and adaptive capacity of the workers and marginalised local communities. ICLEIs experience in the region also reflects these findings. Previous work in the region, including in Kurseong, has shown that local communities are rarely involved in the critical aspect of water resource management by local governments. This results in lack of ownership of water related projects and subsequent lack of support by local communities. This means that eventually projects may fall into disrepair, if local communities do not use them properly and carefully. More importantly, the linkages of water resource conservation and solid waste management needs to be highlighted and dealt with effectively to keep water resources clean and safe. Gender aspects of water use and management is also not considered in the planning and implementation of water projects.  This project intends to tackle the water crisis faced by the local communities by using traditional knowledge and community led practices for rainwater harvesting, spring revival, reuse and upcycling of wastewater through coordinated and collaborative efforts of the communities, the local governments and the private sector involving the tea estates and hotels. The project envisages the crucial involvement of local communities, particularly women, right from the development of action plans, their implementation and monitoring as well as replication and scale up. A cadre of barefoot hydrogeologists will be trained from among the local communities, focusing on local women and youth, giving them the necessary wherewithal to Oak Application Form     8prepare basic water conservation plans and manage their resources in collaboration with other stakeholders.",

        "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. OBJECTIVESThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain what you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We understand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a multitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define your role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss this with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   7.a. ObjectivesList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals that can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are ambitious but also achievable.  The project aims to create and institutionalize a replicable model for community-led Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), to develop and implement Water Security Plans for tea estates that will help to improve the quality, quantity, access and reliability of water for local communities. The specific objectives of the project include: - To mobilise and build capacity of local indigenous community and migrant tea estate workers as barefoot hydrogeologists, who are able to assess water issues as well as design and implement locally-owned interventions that promote water conservation and rejuvenation, in collaboration with local governments and tea estate management. - To improve overall water availability and equitable access to water, thereby enhancing the adaptive capacity and resilience of local communities.- To create an institutional platform consisting of local governments, community representatives, and tea estate management, for overall management and robust monitoring of the implementation of water security plans, and ensure potential scale up and sustainability. 7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):What do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here the main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this grant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes describe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some Oak Application Form     9examples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, agency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.The expected outcomes of the project are: - community led and managed water security plans institutionalized in at least 4 tea estates, and adopted by the local governments in the region. - a cohort of barefoot hydrogeologists including women, formed and institutionalized in the region who can eventually not only identify local water issues, but also design and implement interventions to address such issues and act as local ambassadors for water resource management. At least seven to ten  barefoot hydrogeologists in each tea-estate  to be trained and capacitated. It is also envisaged that at least 50 percent of these barefoot hydrogeologists will be women.- locally responsive water conservation measures implemented collaboratively by local communities, local governments and tea estate management.- creation of a societal platform for local communities and tea estate management to engage and influence the local governments for safe and sustainable water resources.It is well acknowledged that enhancing water security positively influences various socio-economic and environmental aspects. In the project region, women typically are responsible for collection of water and enhanced water security will reduce the workload for women, providing them with more time for education, income-generating activities and community participation. Therefore, it is envisaged that the larger impact of the project will extend  beyond access to water, and will lead to improved health of women in particular but also their families, better access to sanitation, improved solid waste management to clean up water resources, enhanced livelihoods, and, in general, lead to resilient communities.  7.c. Activities and timeframe (bullet points):List in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to to carry out to achieve your expected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and and dont include the full list of every activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant will fund. If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a work plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) Training on movement building for...The project activities and their timelines are outlined below: 1. Regional scoping and selection of target area of work (M1 - M4)- Selection of 4 target tea estates where the project will be implemented. This will be based on several factors such as:-    Water resources: availability of basic information about water resources and associated issues, watershed area covered by the tea estates, perenniality etc.-    Tea estate: whether owned by the government or private; size of the tea estate; commitment and support from the tea estate management; support from the tea estate unions, proximity and connectivity among others.Oak Application Form     10-    Local communities: size and type of the population, socio-economic conditions, marginalized and disadvantaged population especially women (e.g., migrant laborer, indigenous population), cultural and traditional practices among others-    Presence of Oak/non-Oak partners: opportunity to enhance the synergies between the existing organizations in the tea-estate to ensure maximum impactA list of tea estates will be prepared and analyzed considering the above-mentioned parameters, and will be shared with the Oak Foundation for their review and final selection. 2. Baseline assessment (M2 - M8) - A baseline data assessment of water resource related data, hydro-geological mapping, demography, water use, will be conducted to get ground level information through secondary data collectionThe project team will conduct focused group discussions (FGDs) to verify the secondary information collected from different resources. 3. Gap identification and vulnerability assessment (M6 - M15) - Identification of local issues and climate vulnerability of the regional water resources as well as vulnerability of the local population will be studied. Through FGDs and stakeholder consultations, interventions will be identified to address the water related issues of local communities, with emphasis on traditional practices to address issues on water conservation and management in the region.  4. Training and capacity building of barefoot hydrogeologists (M10 - M30) - Selection of interested community members, including women and youth will be conducted based on the interest of the local communities shown in the FGDs or other consultations. They will be trained as barefoot hydrogeologists and hand holding support will be provided to help them institutionalise the process of local water management.5. Development and government ratification of water security plans (M12 - M22) - Community led and managed water security plans will be prepared by involving all stakeholders including local communities, tea estate management and local governments to identify possible interventions. Opportunities of funding the plans through government or private fund sources will be identified to facilitate its implementation.6. Identification and on ground implementation of pilots (M20 - M30) - Based on local needs assessment, pilot projects will be selected by the local communities and barefoot hydrogeologists from the region for implementation. The selected pilot will be determined from a range of options identified in the water security plans developed. The local communities and barefoot hydrogeologists will identify traditional methods of water conservation and use, through FGDs that can be adapted and replicated as pilot projects. The project team will facilitate the selection by providing technical inputs.7. Institutionalisation and monitoring (M25 - M32) - A framework will be developed for monitoring and used to monitor the implementation of the pilots and the water security plans developed by the barefoot hydrogeologists and societal platform of different stakeholders 8. Dissemination (M32 - M35) - Dissemination of the work and identification of replication opportunities will begin from the training phase, and continue through the project, but will be strengthened at the later stage of the project.9. Reporting and publication (M35-M36) - Some publications are planned during the project, particularly for recording the training process of the Oak Application Form     11barefoot hydrogeologists and the community level interventions implemented; final reporting of project activities will be carried out at the end of the project.",
        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):The project proposes to develop a collaborative platform to bring together different stakeholders from government, private sector, NGOs and local communities (particularly women from indigenous and migrant communities) to develop, implement and monitor locally led and managed water security plans. The platform will facilitate interaction between the stakeholders to implement and monitor actions on ground that promote water security that can be scaled up regionally.The information from the gap analysis in the water and sanitation systems and climate vulnerability assessment of the indigenous community, migrant workers and existing water resources will be analysed to develop a climate resilient and equitable Community Led Water Security Plans (WaSP) through this platform with full involvement of the local communities, particularly the cadre of trained barefoot hydrogeologists. ICLEI SA will consult with the local communities (particularly women), migrant workers, tea estate owners and local authorities through workshops and focused group discussions to develop a list of possible interventions, both infrastructural and non-infrastructural. The plans will be ratified by the local governments through their councils to ensure government support, both through supportive policies and possible funding programmes.The Water Security Plans will be developed with particular focus on women, who are largely responsible for household level management of water, but not often engaged in the planning or management of the resources. In addition, tea estate management, being responsible for all actions within their estates, will be involved in the process for greater transparency and engagement. Local governments, responsible for water supply,will be engaged to collaborate and partner with the communities so that all actions are legitimate and acceptable to all parties. ICLEI South Asia regularly works with different stakeholders, governments, communities and private sector to prepare and implement plans. Usually, most of the focus is on engaging local governments, but in this case, the focus will be on the local communities and enabling them to take responsibility of their resources in collaboration with the government.

        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING This section is twofold. Please tell us:a) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):A design and monitoring framework will be formulated to monitor the project progress and success, clearly articulating the links between issues, interventions, outputs, outcomes and ultimate impact in the context of ensuring water security. The framework will have clearly specified, measurable, achievable targets such as number of households with improved access to water/sanitation, amount/quality of water harvested, number of community engagement events, number of barefoot hydrogeologists (especially women) trained, etc. The framework will articulate the ultimate impact of the project on a larger scale such as improved public health, increased environmental sustainability, and overall well-being of communities. The progress against each indicator will be monitored depending on its objective, either monthly, bi-annually or annually.  The framework will include elements to assess the gender and social inclusivity throughout the project cycle. A stakeholder group, composed of key representatives from marginalized and indigenous populations, especially women, will be formed to act as a voice for the larger population. The  stakeholders group will be involved throughout the planning and implementation of the project. They will provide inputs to the formulation of WaSP, identifying potential interventions to enhance access to water as well as during the implementation and finally operation and maintenance. Open dialogues will be conducted with the targeted population to build trust and ensure that selected interventions are responsive to the needs and aspirations of the community.The process will include quantitative and qualitative information gathered from the beneficiaries through participatory methods. Such qualitative information from the beneficiaries and communities can provide valuable insights and contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the project success.In addition, a methodology will be identified that can be used periodically by the platform of stakeholders to assess the implementation of the water security plan and monitor it over time. The barefoot hydrogeologists will also be trained on relevant and high-quality data collection for better monitoring. The project will introduce and institutionalize a feedback loop mechanism where community feedback will be incorporated into ongoing MEL processes. Participatory workshops or Focus Group Discussions will be Oak Application Form     13organized semi-annually to get their inputs. By integrating a monitoring framework into Water security plans, stakeholders can make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and continuously improve strategies to ensure water availability and access for all while safeguarding the environment.The project will embrace adaptive management principles to ensure that the plan remains relevant and effective in a dynamic environment. Regular review meetings are planned with Oak Foundation to monitor progress and outputs and based on the findings, the team will make necessary adjustments to the project plan by modifying strategies, reallocating resources, or revising targets.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):The major risks identified for the project include: 1. Non-cooperation by the tea estates: Lack of awareness, common interest, competing priorities or simply no interest towards the larger cause of enhancing water resilience can lead to non-cooperation by the tea estates. Since the project interventions are planned within the boundaries of selected tea estates, it is imperative to bring them on board. The project team will select tea estates that are open minded and interested to improve the water resource situation during the initial assessment. Continuous engagement from the beginning throughout the project  will build their trust and sensitize them toward the issue. 2. Non-cooperation by the local communities: Building trust in external people coming in to resolve local issues is not easy. The project team plans to extensively engage with the communities, including having local staff around for continuous communication, so that trust can be built over time. 3. Political changes: Changes in political leadership, lack of political will or competing priorities can impact the project implementation. Local governments will be engaged right from the beginning and a nodal official will be identified for continuous communication. ICLEIs presence in the region and previous connections will also be useful in this matter.4. Data and information gaps: Insufficient or unreliable data on water resources, usage, and quality can impact informed decision-making and planning. In such a case, state or regional level data will be extrapolated.5. Financial constraints: Lack of funding or budgetary constraints can hinder the implementation of necessary infrastructure and interventions for improving water security. ICLEI is already making plans of applying for Oak Application Form     14funding from other sources and will also explore local government budgets, or state government schemes such as Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo or Jalatirtho will be explored for possible funding. It is to be noted that most of the centrally-sponsored schemes and programmes are not well-supported and implemented in the state of West Bengal, so stress will be on state schemes.",

Highlight any significant recent or expected future changes. If you have an explicit approach to increasing diversity and/or advancing race equity within the organisation, please tell us. (300 words):Indo Global Social Service Society (IGSSS) has been a prominent social service and development support organization in India. It was incorporated in 1960 and, since its inception, it has supported a variety of social development projects all over the country. Its vision has been to create a humane social order based on truth, equity, freedom, and justice with special emphasis on women, children, and the vulnerable sections of society. Right from its inception IGSSS focuses on social equity and economic justice. And we continue to work with the communities in marginal territories. In the last 63 years, IGSSS has gone through various transitions. Till recently, we used to fund small NGOs but for the last two years, we have become a full-fledged implementing organisation. And right now we are going through on organizational development process focusing on State based approach enabling state units as independent units.IGSSS is guided by an eminent board which meets every quarter to review and guide the organization. The Board also sets policy directions and reviews the impact we are making. The staff team is headed by the Executive Director and organizational leadership is provided through the ED and the senior management team that comprises the Organization Program Sustainability (OPS) Leads, Finance Leads and Thematic Leads. This team collectively shapes ideas for future actions and steering organizational efforts. The interventions are anchored at the state level where State coordinators direct and execute state-level actions. IGSSS comprises over 200 staff now, with over 30% of staff being women and IGSSS promotes gender diversity and inclusion of different marginal spectrum groups in hiring and promotion.For additional details please visit: http://igsss.org/  5b. Summarise the organisations history.  In addition, highlight 2-3 key achievements.Please keep this brief and list up to 3 key achievements as bullet points. Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)The organization in the 1960s evolved as a financial grant-making agency with a mandate to work against hunger and poverty. It initially began its operations as Indo-German Social Service Society working with the funds received through funding partners in Germany. In the 1980s the focus shifted to support projects in food production, health care and education, vocational training, employment, and rural development. The renowned Smile Programme (Student Mobilization Initiative for Learning through Exposure) was also started as a national program by IGSSS in 1985. By the 1990s, IGSSS expanded its presence from Delhi to pan India, opening Oak Application Form     6regional offices. It moved from being a funding agency to a supporting organization with collaborations with other NGOs. In the post-2000s era, IGSSS turned a new leaf and adopted a more rights-based approach, underwent an organizational development process, and changed in name, with a renewed vision and mission and strategic thrust areas identified. The organization's name had evolved into the present Indo-Global Social Service Society to reflect the association with global donors. It was in this phase that the homeless program was initiated as a direct implementation. IGSSS in the 2010s decade evolved as a leading grant-making organization in India supporting smaller grass-roots NGOs across the length and breadth of the country. Since 2019 onwards, IGSSS has remodelled our work as an implementing agency, with a new HR structure with state offices and digital strengthening for a people-led global and grassroots action for a just society.IGSSS has been concerned with urban poverty since the turn of the Millennium. Working in over 35 cities, more than 200,000 families have benefitted through 2015  2020. IGSSS now has extensive experience in urban poverty interventions in India and is widely networked with existing CSO actors and movements. In our actions since 2018, we have gradually developed our understanding of sustainability in the urban context and since 2020, through Satat Shehar Programme (2020  ongoing), we have through climate vulnerabilities and impact lens started to mainstream climate action with 260 urban poor communities leading the change. We are having internal organizational experience working with rural climate change actions for many decades and that is helping us immensely in the existing work. This intervention is spread across 13 cities in mostly north, central, and eastern Indian cities with a focus on slums and community development for Unnat Bastis (developedmodel slums). We also have a climate change thematic, that closely works with urban thematic to address urban poor / worker climate change issues in the project actions. IGSSS is also working with governments across scales to push climate action and resilience building, some efforts in Jharkhand, Kashmir, and Odisha are noteworthy. Aside from Satat shehar intervention, in December 2021, IGSSS embarked on initiating a new project for informal workers under the title of Punarnirman (Build back better) (2021-ongoing) for informal workers and their issues of insecure livelihoods, especially in the post  COVID phase in 160 worker collectives. This intervention is spread across 8 cities in mostly north, central, and eastern Indian cities.Climate resilience building for informal sector workers has been completely missed in the state-led interventions till now. Our engagement with worker groups shares the need for an increased focus on developing an understanding of climate impacts and building capacities to deal with them will be critical for informal workers in India. We have made sufficient progress on climate actions since 2020 in urban when we brought in climate action as part of urban interventions. In urban, we are working with the urban poor in behavioural aspects, as well as to secure their settlements. And are already collaborating with numerous experts and organizations on the same.[1]  IGSSS is also increasingly taking up the role of policy development for climate actions through its participation in COP 26 and other national/international platforms to amplify the needs and requirements of urban poor constituents. Lately, we have pushed climate action for informal workers in our national networking meeting under the Punarnirman project action and have just initiated small studies to assess the loss and Oak Application Form     7damage of informal workers; and propose/ frame actions/ policies for different workers to deal with climate impacts.IGSSS interventions in the last many years have seen dozens of policy changes at the state and national levels and successful model interventions  including the successful policy contributions that transformed into guidelines through NULM-SUH, welfare measures for urban poor - homeless during COVID, PMSVANIDHI, and other numerous policy improvements.  Recently IGSSS along with informal worker leaders and federations of hawkers, met representatives of ILO and NitiAyog to push the climate impact agenda of informal workers into policy action. In April 2023, IGSSS was also made a task-force member for NULM 2.0 redrafting process. by MoHUA. It is needed that urgently, in this phase of Indias policy development towards climate resilience, urban informal workers and their impacts, and loss are highlighted to make the policy framework inclusive.  [1] IGSSS through its much older rural work on climate change, and now increasing work on urban climate action is already in collaboration with organizations like CANSA, TERI, INECC and so on. 5c.

(600 words):ContextInformal workers form the mainstay of the Indian economy. They constitute a significant portion of the Indian workforce, estimated to be around 90% of the total workforce.[1] Yet they face a lack of job security, low wages, and poor working conditions. They are also not eligible for benefits such as pension, insurance, and paid leave, which are available to formal sector workers. The live-work conditions of informal workers, especially in cities are an ignored reality wherein the formal state-led (exclusionary) urban vision has neglected the settlements that house the informal workers. Whilst there are initiatives taken by the state to bring the workers rights under a broad umbrella of reformed legislations to provide social security to informal workers, the coverage is still limited and restricted, and not holistic.[2]The COVID pandemic has ruptured the status quo and lifted the veil on the fault lines in our society. The crisis uncovered the sheer lack of security  social and economic  and the mere reach that the state extended on its vulnerable people. The pandemic began in the cities in India. The hardest hit is the most invisible poor  informal workers, migrant workers and marginal groups living in slums and other makeshift dwellings, across urban geographies.  As the economy is gradually returning to normalcy, in the post-pandemic era, numerous initiatives with a climate resilience perspective are being undertaken at a national level including dovetailing existing Oak Application Form     8developmentinfrastructure programs into climate change discourse. Unfortunately, very less of this is concerned with urban informal workers' livelihoods and life in the city.Situation Analysis: Assessing the situation of workers in the Kolkata Metropolitan AreaThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area in the Indian state of West Bengal, centred around the city of Kolkata (also known as Calcutta). It is the largest urban agglomeration in the eastern part of India and the third largest in the country, housing over 14.85 million people, as of the 2011 census. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is comprised of the city of Kolkata, its suburbs, several neighbouring towns (including 4 municipal corporations, and 27 municipalities) and adjoining rural areas. It is the economic, cultural, and educational hub of eastern India and hosts several major commercial and industrial centres, making it one of the most important economic zones in India.[3]Informal workers like street vendors, domestic workers, construction workers and waste pickers are expected to be around 20 - 25 lakh (over 2 million) in a similar situation as other parts of the country, without much social security and living in the margins of the current developmental discourse. The KMA also has a large informal sector that employs a significant number of migrant workers, particularly in construction, domestic work, and small-scale industries. These workers face compounded challenges such as low wages, long working hours, and poor working conditions. Many of them live in makeshift housing and lack access to basic amenities like clean water, sanitation, and health care. Migrant workers face social challenges, such as discrimination, isolation, and limited access to education and health services. It is estimated that around 50% of the informal workers (1 million) are migrants, with an equal percentage from other districts of Bengal and migrants from other states like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Assam. An equal or similar share of outmigration is reported as well.[4]The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is also located precariously. Like many other coastal cities in the world, is facing a range of impacts from climate change and is listed in the top eight megacities to be first impacted by climate change. The city is in the deltaic region of eastern India, which makes it vulnerable to sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and heat waves.[5] The changing climate is leading to an increased risk of coastal flooding and erosion, as well as water scarcity, particularly during the dry season. The city's infrastructure and public services, including transportation, energy, and water systems, are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which can strain these systems and result in economic losses. In addition to the physical impacts, the changing climate also has social and economic impacts on the people of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. The most impacted areas overlapping directly with the informal worker settlements in the region are vulnerable to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased poverty because of climate change.To address these challenges, the government in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, led by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are taking steps to increase the region's resilience to climate change. This includes implementing flood control measures, improving disaster preparedness and response, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and preparing climate action plans for Oak Application Form     9their cities.[6][7] The major concern in the slew of positively directed actions is that informal workers, their live-work settlements and their livelihoods as of now are not a major focus area of the climate resilience actions pushed by the state and authorities. Thereby ignoring the most vulnerable, impacted informal workers from the climate resilience action plans for the region. Also straight-jacketed approaches of focusing on the urban infrastructure building, without focusing on capacities and linkages ignoring migration from climate-impacted rural regions is another gap amongst many in the climate resilience actions. This approach requires a change: in perspective and in action.  That is what PARIVARTAN intervention sets to achieve  CHANGE that is for and led by the empowerment of the most vulnerable informal worker communities.The situation analysis and approach have been developed in discussion with experts on climate actions and informal workers, existing secondary sources, IGSSS urban teams' experience and previous consultations organized by IGSSS. The project aims to keep inclusion, equity and diversity of informal workers along with gender concerns at the core of project interventions.[1] In India, informal workers are those individuals who work in unorganized sectors and are not covered by labour laws or social security measures. This segment of the workforce includes self-employed individuals, casual labourers, street vendors, domestic workers, and other unorganized sector workers.[2] The labour codes in India refer to a set of laws and regulations that govern various aspects of employment, including wages, working conditions, social security, and industrial relations. In 2020, the Indian government introduced four new labour codes, namely, the Code on Wages, the Industrial Relations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, and the Social Security Code.[3] https://kmda.wb.gov.in/[4] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/more-migrants-to-city-from-other-states-than-districts/articleshow/70354414.cms[5] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/disaster-deaths-sinking-unprepared-kolkata-face-multiple-climate-risks-warns-ipcc-report-82004[6] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-set-to-get-own-climate-action-plan-2nd-city-after-mum/articleshow/92049423.cms[7] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/cop27-kolkata-presents-climate-action-roadmap-announces-city-level-summit-86026",

Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) Training on movement building for...The Proposed Actions & Levels of InterventionsAmongst the informal sector workers in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area  a special focus will be on Construction, Domestic Workers, Waste Pickers, Rickshaw pullers and Street Vendors in select urban areas of KMA. As an approach to look at the urban-rural continuum for interventions, the migrants will be treated as a special category to ensure safeinformed migration to the KMA through gradually evolved networks.  It is to be noted that there is also a special gendered marginality within these groups, where women's participation and vulnerability are increasing. Aside from the four population groups of informal workers, future informal workers (gig workers) and climate-impacted refugee migrants will be closely worked with, special attention will be given to vulnerable-dependent groups within workers like women, single women, elderly and so on.The main set of actions for building resilient worker collectives is the following:At the local/micro level1. Building self-reliant worker collectives through monthly meetings & 8 capacity building training and workshops in 4 years. The focus will be on climate-resilient livelihood capacity building, education, and skills training. 12 localized campaigns to access basic services and entitlements.2. Access to finance and initiating collective income generation actions through 8 training courses for incubating models.3. Special focus on the inclusion of women workers and migrant workers.At the community/ meso level4. 8 disaster risk reduction education and preparedness in worker settlements/worksites. And 6 interface meetings will be planned to present preparedness plans to representatives and government departments.5. Select 50 improved and resilient infrastructures in worker settlements/worksites. At the city/state & network / macro level6. 8 ULB-level and 4 state-level CSO networking meetings for strengthening social/legal protection systems by workers as well as by the state.7. 4 Policy engagement for inclusion of workers.8. 3 Collaboration between ULBs, government, private agencies, and civil society organizations.9. Developing ruralurban linkages through 8 campaigns by CSO networks and worker leaders for migrant workers.10. 8 federation buildings of informal sector workers in KMA, West Bengal & sharing at the National level.Oak Application Form     13The main set of actions for building resilient worker collectives is the following:At the local /micro level1.Building self-reliant worker collectives: Informal workers access their identification, entitlements, and basic services through community-managed WRCs (worker resource centres) in the local and collectives formalize as membership-based organizations for self-reliance. In year 1, community mobilization will be the focus, in years 2 & 3 gradually the focus will shift towards self-reliance and local-level resilience, in year 4 there will be a focus shift towards worker collectives sustainability and formalization of collectives.2.Climate-resilient livelihood capacity building and training: Providing training and capacity-building opportunities to informal workers on climate-resilient livelihood practices and techniques can help them to better adapt to changing conditions. Year 1 actions will be directed at understanding the issues of workers through a climate lens, making action plans and acting on them. At the outset, there will be PLA workshops organized with different workers themselves and through those exercises, the nuanced nature of impacts will be mapped and then the resilience practices will be developed accordingly. The practices will differ for each population group as their nature of work differs dramatically. Years 2 & 3 will lead to more focused capacity building on climate resilience. Year 4 will document  formalize the impacts, success, and challenges of capacity-building actions. To address the gender aspects sub-group worker workshops will be hosted to and through facilitation will the gender issues be noted and an action plan developed. Years 2 & 3 will lead to more focused capacity building on climate resilience. Year 4 will document  formalize the impacts, success, and challenges of capacity-building actions.3.Providing education and skills training: Workers, especially, women and migrant workers can benefit from education and skills training programs that can help them upgrade their skills/ upscale actions and find better-paying jobs. Baseline mapping and needs will be assessed in year 1, and support/ training initiated for skilling. Year 2 will focus on assessing the impacts and improving the modules. Years 3 & 4 will scale, document, and share the impacts, successes, and challenges of skilling workers.4.Access to finance and initiating collective income generation actions: Providing access to finance, including microfinance services, can help informal workers in Kolkata start new businesses or diversify their income streams, making them more resilient to the impacts of climate change. NULM - SHG funds are expected to be a resource for such program actions. Or programs like PMSVANIDHI that were introduced by govt. post covid for street vendors. This is especially critical in post-COVID times. Like other capacity-building actions, year 1 will assess the needs and initiate income generation skilling and designing project actions, and years 2 & 3 will be about piloting them and documenting their impacts. Year 3 will scale, document, and share the impacts, successes, and challenges of income generation modules.Oak Application Form     145.Special focus on inclusion of women workers and migrant workers: As a practice and strategy, the aim will be to focus on the most vulnerable workers like women workers and migrant workers for all actions to ensure their inclusion.At the community/ meso level6.Disaster risk reduction education and preparedness in worker settlements/worksites: Informal workers should be educated on disaster risk reduction measures, including evacuation procedures, early warning systems, and proper storage and handling of goods. This is to be executed both at informal workers' livelihood sites as well as their living settlements. Year 1 will be aimed at simplified understanding and mapping of climate impacts, disaster risks and threats on maps documenting them. Year 2 will be focused on acting on them and developing preparedness in communities and engaging with authorities for executing them. Years 3 & 4 will repeat the process and refresh preparedness plans and task force teams from communities will be ready for any disasters.7.Improved and resilient infrastructure in worker settlements/worksites: Improving the infrastructure in informal worker communities, such as street vendor markets and in their living settlements - slums, can help to reduce their exposure to extreme weather events and improve their overall living/ working conditions. Starting from preparedness and evacuation maps in year 1, in year 2 community-led planning for improved  resilient settlements and worksites will be initiated and submitted as Local Area Plans (LAPs) to the authorities. In years 3 & 4, the exercise will be undertaken further to improve the condition of the settlement to a model settlement that can be upscaled later. With the last year to focus on documentation and scaling of resilience-building practices. At the city/state & network / macro level8.Strengthening social/legal protection systems by workers as well as by the state: The worker collectives to self-help and support their members. And Governments and a network of civil society organizations should work to strengthen social protection systems for informal workers in Kolkata, such as providing access to health insurance, legal assistance, and food assistance during times of crisis. In Year 1,2 along with CSO support worker communities will be supported for sociallegal assistance. Year 3 practices and methods will be documented during implementation. Year 4 impacts will be assessed, practices improved and actions scaled.  9.Policy engagement for inclusion of workers: Policy engagement efforts can help to address the systemic issues that contribute to the vulnerability of informal workers in Kolkata, including promoting decent working conditions and strengthening labour laws. Policy briefs will be prepared in all the years and submitted to relevant authorities for policy progression.10.Collaboration between ULBs, government, private agencies, and civil society organizations: Collaboration between ULBs, government agencies, private agencies and civil society Oak Application Form     15organizations can help to ensure that the needs and concerns of informal workers are addressed in the development and implementation of climate resilience measures. Pilot programs and demonstrations are to be executed through formal collaborations with the government where possible. Year 1 will focus mostly on sharing practices and experiences. Year 2 will work on the implementation of collaborative actions and Years 3 & 4 will focus on the formalization of actions and collaborations.11.Developing ruralurban linkages through CSO networks and worker leaders for migrant workers: Building community support networks: Migrant workers can benefit from community support networks that provide them with emotional and practical support. These networks can also help them access resources and services that they might not otherwise be able to access. Year 1 will focus mostly on sharing practices and experiences. Years 2 & 3 on piloting engagements and exchanges with networks, and communities. Year 4 will document, upscale and formalize the interventions, vis--vis migrants.12.Federation building of informal sector workers in KMA, West Bengal & sharing at the National level: The worker collectives, CSOs and networks will work together to mainstream informal workers' concerns in emerging issues of urban development and climate resilience building. There will be a workers federation emerging in KMA, and through networking at the state level and national levels, the worker's issues will be mainstreamed with climate resilience actions. As per the collectives strength, guidance and support will be offered from year 1 onwards. With a special focus to scale efforts in year 2 and on building formal institutions in years 3 and 4.Strategies for the Interventions1.Vision for Sustainable Cities & Resilience Building as the overarching framework for Interventions for IGSSS: The changed context of Indian cities is the key reason for the proposition of an overarching framework of sustainable cities that addresses not only the issue of inclusivity but equity along with the issues of sustainability, resilience, urban governance and participation in the city making process. The vision for sustainable cities developed in 2020 still holds good and needs to be furthered with the resilience building of informal worker communities. IGSSS has since 2020 moved beyond sustainability, but also is in the process of developing a holistic organizational process for resilience building. The ongoing churning also forms the basis for the interventions proposed in the proposed intervention.2.Demystifying climate resilience for enabling localized actions: To enable localized actions, it is important to demystify climate resilience by breaking it down into more manageable components. It will be expected that IGSSS collaborates and partner with technical agencies with expertise in climate action, but the project will strive to develop community expertise in addressing the resilience needs.  By taking steps to demystify climate resilience for informal workers, Oak Application Form     16localized actions can be taken to support these workers in adapting to and building resilience against the impacts of climate change. This can help ensure that the most vulnerable members of society are not left behind in the face of this global challenge.3.Planned interventions in all levels and scales  The proposed interventions are imagined to be at the level of local/ micro level, community/ meso level, city, state, and national/ macro level. The local/micro will focus mostly on informal worker collectives and their needs in the local like capacities, training, access to identity, entitlements and so on. At the community level/ meso level, the focus is more on developing resilience at their working and living sites and will involve engagements with the wider community. At the city, state, and national/macro levels, the focus will be on policy change and network building. This differential level intervention has worked well in the previous IGSSS actions and suits well for an informal worker climate resilience project, and we hope to improve the same in the coming interventions.4.Gradual/strategic development of project actions led by worker collectives starting from micro to macro:  Since the focus of the project is community mobilization leading to resilience building, the focus initially (year 1) will be on building capacities of the collectives, starting with initial low hanging fruits like entitlements and identity documents, then going on to engage on meso level issues of developing the worker settlements, then with support from CSO network groups could influence and reach out to government and private players accountability. As we move towards year 2 and year 3, the focus will shift from collectivization to collective action on objective2 (community level) and 3 (city/state federations). Objective 1 actions will be led by worker leaders themselves in the long run and are imagined to be sustainable in a span of two project cycles.5.People (worker) led development in the micro, meso, and IGSSS-led action in the macro level: The worker and community collectives in the local are expected to take complete ownership of the actions at the local and community level. Training and mobilization of worker collectives will be the prerogative of IGSSS local staff. The state staff will focus on networking// federation at the city/ state level for collaborative actions. The IGSSS Thematic will steer networking at a national level and contribute to the policy discourse on climate change, informal workers and urbanization in India and Global South from a resilience lens.6.Developing peoples institutions and organizations: The proposed program envisages that community collectives/ peoples organizations do not just remain as community-based initiatives in the project period but sustain and continue to work as bulwarks of local democracy and urban resilience for worker communities. This will be attempted through a host of capacity building and handholding of the worker collectives. Alongside this, the key strategy will be to work at their personal level on life skills, building resilience and developing a mechanism for reporting violations and abuses to key points for address and preservation of dignity in their lives, also by supporting Oak Application Form     17the community collectives to adopt sustainable and resilience building initiatives in their local and community level.7.Building networks and sustaining established ones  The terrain from the national level policy engagement has shifted to the state and ULB levels. It is in this context that the premise of community federations into a larger critical mass is foundational to having larger-level policy engagement. Community collectives, extremely successful locals, need spaces and opportunities to collaborate and learn from each other to raise bigger demands for more inclusive city spaces and participatory decision-making. This underlying theme forms the other fundamental assumption in the project design. Consequently, such spaces for forming city-level and state-level federations are provided for in the project intervention that will go a long way in engaging with the state and mainstreaming the informal workers and climate justice discourse in policy circles. It is also expected that these networks that develop will be composed of middle-class groups, and private agencies/ bodies as well, with a common consensus developed with the informal workers to demand climate resilience and sustainable cities for all.8.Policy engagement, as well as collaboration with the different levels of the government  Engagement and working with the state, is put forth as the only way to better the development of communities and cities. Especially for informal workers in the context of climate resilience building. The reason why the different levels of state and bureaucracy fail to function as expected is because of the lack of engagement, access and proximity to the urban poor issues, it is this gap that the project wishes to address between the communities and the state, through multifarious engagements from the local community development plans to the state - national policy level discussions. The state, especially the ULBs are looking for collaborative opportunities with organizations for climate action and that space needs to be utilized. Existing Oak Foundation partners with networks will also aid in the process of building collaborations, especially with the private sector.9.Thematic Hub of Urban Poverty Reduction contributes to national-level policy discourse: The last phase has initiated the development of the Urban Poverty Thematic Hub in IGSSS, it is in now a steering position to direct the national discourse on sustainable urbanization, wrt to informal workers and their inclusion in urban resilience  climate actions. With a good number of partners and networks, it is expected that a strong national network will emerge to keep a close watch on policy development and aid in developing the understanding of urban poor and climatic justice discourse with the CSOs and wider public nationally, and internationally.10.Research and documentation will be integral to the project and would strengthen the engagement initiatives. The city and state-level situations/ datasets of the target groups will be consolidated at the national level for effective engagement. The information from cities and states shall also help in building/contributing to campaigns, collaborations, and policy engagement at the state/national level.Staff structureOak Application Form     18The staff structure is to suit the implementation reality. There will be more focus on rooting the interventions with the community mobilisers, who will be leading the interventions in the communities mostly under micro-level actions. The community mobilisers will be supported by a community coordinator who capacitates communities for meso actions and supports networking at the city/state level. The capacity building and training officer will be entrusted with training communities, and leaders through IGSSS city & local staff and developing and executing the training modules. The project coordinator will be the executing in charge of the project. The thematic leads on urban and climate change will lead the overall envisioning and coordination of key actions in the project. IGSSS already has an existing office and presence directly / indirectly in the KMA.The key project staff and their corresponding core responsibilities:Position Role and functionsThematic Lead Urban Poverty & Climate Change  part supportThematic and visioning inputs to informal workers and climate resilienceCoordinating capacity building and training of IGSSS staff and personnelCoordinating Research, documentation, and publicationsSupporting networking and policy engagement at the city, state, and national levelProject CoordinatorEnsures execution of the project and the achievement of the objectivesSupport and coordinate the direct interventions, engagement and networking at city and state levelGuiding capacitating IGSSS team and CSO networks on informal workers' issuesCoordinating & developing modules for the implementation of the projectSupervise the Programme and Finance personnel in the project in all matters of programme implementation and management.Ensure proper documentation of reports, MIS and programme reportingCapacity Building & Training Coordinator  part supportCapacitating the IGSSS team and CSO networksDeveloping content and material for modules for project implementationEnsuring quality training and practicesResearch, Documentation officer  part supportLeading research, documentation, and model documentationIdentifying programme implementation successDocumentation and reporting of the interventions and outcomesOak Application Form     19Sharing and dissemination of research/documentationCity Coordinators Planning and implementation of the project in the intervention communities, with a focus  on community-level actions  and campaignsCapacitating worker communities based on training modulesLeading engagement with ULBs and diverse stakeholders  at the  city levelDocumenting and studying policy-level changes and developmentsCommunity MobilisersLeading community level  local interventions Capacity building and training of community leadersCoordinating with community worker volunteers for the local-level interventionsFinance officers Will be responsible for the overall financial management of IGSSS likeBudgetary ControlKeeping track of revenue and expenseMeeting all financial statutory requirementsSalary disbursementFacilitating AuditingCheck and balance systems in financial management and ensure that all financial rules and guidelines are adhered to",

How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):Monitoring plan of IGSSSAll projects implemented by IGSSS begin with the bassline and sets the targets to be achieved. Both the project implementation and financial accounting are investigated at the time of the monitoring visit by the teams. PME unit and Programme Management teams also visit the field and provide support to ensure that implementation/operations are on track. Half-yearly review meeting with teams is also conducted regionally for result tracking and cross-learning.Management Information System (MIS)The project level MIS begins with - 1. Analysis and benchmarking of a baseline study of any project before its inception at the project level. Thereafter 2. refinement of the project indicators based on RBM and IGSSS strategic plans may be carried out. In discussions with funding partners and organizations. 3. Setting up performance tracking tables at the project level with targets and baseline figures to be finalized. 4. Setting project-level tools for recording results. We use e-tools like the Kobo collects app to collect and record data at the field level. Then, 5. periodic data collection and compilation are executed. Usually, this is in sync with the reporting cycles and data is assessed every quarter. Afterwhich 6. Analysis of data generated and reporting is shared with funding partners and within IGSSS as well.  At the organizational level, where project level MIS feeds into. The monitoring and evaluation unit of IGSSS helps the project level actions with 1. setting up of indicators based on IGSSS strategic plan and objectives. 2. pooling out the information from individual projects. 3. periodic data collection and compilation and 4. aid the respective thematic team with reporting as well. Internal Reporting:Within IGSSS, reporting is on a project-to-project basis. IGSSS state units submit their progress reports to the thematic leads. The state coordinators verify the reports and forward them to the thematic with their recommendations and observations. This is vetted and supported by the Urban Poverty Reduction Team. Regular program-related and financial feedback is provided by the grants team, based in Delhi. Technical inputs are also provided on MIS by the M&E working under the grants team. Thematic and financial management support is actively provided to each state to smoothen coordination processes. The yearly audit is carried out on the completion of the Grant period. The state teams prepare timely reports, based on the work done in communities, taking stock of the activities that have been undertaken during that time. The quarterly activity updates and six-monthly reports are submitted to the respective thematic offices of IGSSS. The thematic offices submit a six-Oak Application Form     23monthly report to the Programme Management & Grants team based at IGSSS Delhi. The team reviews the report and verifies the information from other sources and reporting tools. Appropriate feedback is provided to the state offices, where course correction or supportive inputs are required. The urban thematic unit drafts the report, which is then finalized and shared with funding partners.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):Risks, Outlook, Prospects and Sustainability of ActionsThere is an increasing amount of distrust of the authorities towards NGOs and the changed legal rules that discourage networking is one such perfect example. Going forward in the coming years it will be increasingly tough to work on policy engagement and recommendations, it is better to adopt a more  model-based approach. There are also similar locational issues that are bound to impact the interventions. The project proposal rests on the premise that climate-resilient model building and scaling with collaborations with state and non-state actors is the best way forward. And will address the mistrust with some of the authorities. The pandemic has resulted in the state and administration retracting a lot  with respect to the budgets and attention to the urban poor and worker needs. It is expected that the welfare state and policy provisions are bound to shrink in the coming years. Thereby recognizing that policy-level engagements become further complicated. The silver lining though is that the concept of climate resilience for informal workers may be the most suited to this urban poverty team and its interventions for informal workers at this stage of the intervention. As the issue is of prime importance to the state and authorities and will be more receptive to ideas and suggestions for improving the same.Operational challenges: technical financial and partner-related risks.The change in the laws related to Foreign Contribution Regulation in India: The NGOs cannot use 20% of funds in administrative expenses, thereby putting further restrictions in the manner where collaborative and joint interventions will now be restricted or must be strategically reduced to adhere to the guidelines. These factors have been accounted for in the project design.The program design is based on network building and its challenges:  Due to the changed law, the project intervention has been Oak Application Form     24now conceived wholly to be directly implemented by IGSSS. The erstwhile partners and networks of IGSSS in the form of CSOs, CBOs and networks will remain as joint actors for engagement and campaigns, and specific support will be extended to local CSOs who will be engaged with and if needed capacitated to address the issues of climate resilience. Thereby imagining partnerships from the earlier formal project-based collaborations to more organic issue-based non-financial collaborations to allow for the transfer of knowledge and domain knowledge of emerging challenges of urban through networking at levels and scales.  Stressing innovative approaches and income generation for COVID realities: post  COVID economic slowdown and lack of livelihoods are going to be a reality for the next five years. To kick-start the interventions and to ensure the project aims for sustainable practices innovative models have been dovetailed into the proposals. Like  Worker resource centres, will ensure more accessible locations for communities to get access to and resolve their livelihoods concerns. These centres will be run by trained community volunteers. To propagate climate resilience for informal workers practice models will be identified, documented, and scaled with support, and shared for wider implementation across CSO networks. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a livelihood crisis that will be only ameliorated with income generation and community institution/ membership models that this intervention aims to support and nurture for the long term. The following actions/ strategies are thought to ensure the viability of the project: People-led actions and change: The principle of a rights-based approach is at the core of all programming under the proposed initiative, where the focus is on capacitating the workers belonging to the marginalised sections of the urban to access their rights to identity, entitlements, and habitats and livelihoods. The focus on creating a capacitated community leadership and cadre to lead the interventions will also go a long way to ensure that the community efforts remain sustainable. Institution/ capacity building of worker collectives and structures to ensure that the community owns and invests in all development actions planned and implemented in their contexts. This would include worker collectives, CBOs, Self Help Groups, and City level federations that are formalized and transformed to peoples organizations and institutions. The networks and alliances created at the local, state, and national levels with diverse stakeholders and actors will lead to capacitated CSOs working on informal workers and climate resilience. Thereby far outliving the project duration. This will also popularize the informal workers and their climate resilience discourse amongst the many networks and in the development sector in India.   Convergence and collaborations with state and non-state actors: Convergence and collaboration with resources and entitlements from the government have been a central strategy underpinning the work with communities. This will be promoted in this project as well  through linkages with the already listed policy engagements, implementation of existing laws and acts, as well as with the line departments and ULBs of the urban areas. Expenses will be made on the least cost basis without Oak Application Form     25compromising quality. Low-cost meetings, workshops, exposures, conventions, etc. will be arranged so that these can be continued even after the project period with minimal external financial support. Low-cost and climate-conscious project actions: Exploring new ways of working together with minimal resources  for example, collaborations with alliances and networks, sharing of knowledge/know-how with like-minded institutions, and building up a strong case for evidential engagement through joint research and action. The activated communities and networks will be hoped to continue the development work that they learned during the project time. Any support offered in the name of model building and initial grounding of climate resilience models and income generational activities will be left with the community itself. At an organizational level, it is further decided that all meetings and gatherings hosted by IGSSS will avoid the use of plastic. And travels between cities will be promoted through rail only. Only in case of large distances will air/flight will be considered.Phasing of project interventions: IGSSS has imagined and designed this phase of work with informal workers and climate resilience for the 2023-26 phase. IGSSS's understanding of informal workers, and sustainable cities have further improved in the last five years, and we hope to continue with our sustainable  resilient cities framework that the urban team has devised for interventions. The proposed phase will have its evaluations carried out and the strategy for further actions and interventions will be decided in consultation with stakeholders and actors. It is expected that the program will be continued in at least one more phase of interventions in the same area with the constituent groups",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONSPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak programme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. First Set of Questions responded on 17.02.2023The request is heavy on reaching out and collectivizing the workers and their families for claiming entitlements and services and less so on government and private players accountability towards them beyond ensuring the entitlementsComment taken and accepted; this could be tweaked in the proposal if required. But most of the focus initially (year 1) will be at building capacities of the collectives, starting with initial low-hanging fruits like entitlements, then developing the worker settlements (which is very tough), then with support from CSO network groups could influence and reach out to government and private players accountability in year 2. As we move towards year 3 and year 4, the focus will shift from collectivization to Oak Application Form     26collective action on objective2 (community level) and 3 (city/state federations). Objective 1 actions will be led by the worker leaders themselves.Government will be easier, but private players will be a challenge. As shared by you earlier as well, we can reach out / collaborate with jan sahas or other oak foundation partners who are working with private players, that will make the engagements easy to begin with. Please share any other suggestion that you might have.Is there a plan to collaborate with technical organisations on issues like mitigating impact on migrant  workers from heat stress, air and noise pollution ? in other words, build their resilience to the changing climate ?Yes, we have made sufficient progress on climate actions since 2020, when we brought in the climate action as part of urban interventions. Rural interventions have long had climate resilience building programs. In urban, we are working with workers in behavioural aspects, as well as to secure their livelihoods and settlements. And are collaborating with numerous experts and organizations on the same. Like CANSA, TERI, INECC and so on. But we are also clear that it is only worker/ community collectives plus the technical support partners, who can combine think of innovative ways of addressing climate action for workers. As sometimes, it is easy to get stuck in the technicalities and workers lose the connection with the climate impact issue, and solutions are not accessible, easy to scale and replicate. Lately, we have pushed climate action for informal workers in our national networking meeting and have just initiated small studies to assess the loss and damage; and propose/ frame actions/ policies for different workers. I will keep you in loop and posted of the same. Also, we with support frm hawker federation leaders are engaged in policy engagement and advocacy, and recently met ILO and NitiAyog to push climate impact agenda of informal worker into policy action.  Which they have agreed to incorporate.To what extent will the design be drawn based on inputs from primary communities?Oh, very much. I think I answered this question above. It has to be based and led by primary / impacted communities. Or else climate action of mitigation, adaptation and resilience will not succeed. Mitigation might, but other two will not. This is our experience of working on climate change in urban since 2020.What is the expected cost of the project? do you have any committed /potential funding? what is the amount expected from Oak?We have not calculated the expected project costs in detail but are looking at tentatively around 4 Cr for a 4-year intervention. We can think about raising local resources from other donors and existing programs / projects but will be an expecting or seeking Oak to fund majority costs of the same. Will be better to discuss this and the scale of the program as well before arriving at a figure.Explain what is IGSSSs experience on this broad topic? How will you provide key advisory to government bodies to reduce climate impact on workers who have to be in the open to carry out their work  like work Oak Application Form     27with the pollution control board and department of health? Who do you see as the key ecosystem players?IGSSS is having extensive experience of over 12 years of urban poverty interventions in urban. And increasingly, since 2020 we have through climate vulnerabilities and impact lens started to mainstream climate action with communities leading the change. We are having internal organizational experience of working with rural climate change actions for over many decades and that is helping us immensely in the existing/proposed work. We also have a climate change thematic, that closely works with urban thematic to address urban poor / worker climate change issues. We can prepare a note on the measures taken by urban team on climate change actions. IGSSS is also working with governments across scales to push climate action and resilience building.For impacting policies, the first step will be document the impact, calculate the losses, place the requirements  demands from the community into policies and laws for informal workers so to address the damages caused by climate change. We are at this stage of the development and with urban poor communities we have carried out strong  successful pilots in 13 cities. With informal workers taking examples from 8 cities, we are undertaking studies and engaging with policy makers to reframe climate policies wrt to urban poor and workers. The second step shall be to engage with the respective players, the welfare boards, the ULBs, the climate change ministry and other policy think tanks of the state. Thereafter the next step will be to take it to the implementation departments like PCB, health, and so on. The second and third step we wish to undertake in this year.Please share some documents about IGSSSs organogram and board in India. Last information on the FCRA status of IGSSS will be useful.Last information on FCRA status is that it is awarded till March 2023. We have not had any queries and the process was smooth. We are hopeful to have the same approved very soon. Organogram and board details I will be sharing in the mail.  Second Set of Questions responded on 28.03.2023Questions from the Director  India Programme and the President:References where IGSSS's work has been recognized by the policy andSome of the policy impacts are as follows:IGSSS contribution to NULM-SUH in 2011- 2012  IGSSS model shelters for women/ livelihood program for homeless in Delhi 2011-15Notification of holistic response for homeless during COVID outbreak MoHUA - 2020Notification for vaccination for homeless MoHUA  2020Notification of world homeless day in AP, MH, DL  2018 - 2022Notification for winter response and shelters for urban homeless by MoHUA  2021Oak Application Form     28Rules for transgender welfare board in Madhya Pradesh by Social Justice department - 2022Simplification of guidelines / operational manual for working with communities during COVID outbreak & contribution to NDMA NGO coordination group  2020  21National draft policy and acceptance by BMC for city level policy  2021 - 22Allocation by BMC for homeless shelters in Mumbai Development Plan 2014-34 & Allocations in BMC budget  2015 & onwardsFirst set of byelaws for street vendors presented to AMC  2022Policy improvement for slums on railway land  Surat Slum dwellers right to housing recognized.  2022IGSSS part of select organization to assist MoHUA in transformation of NULM 2.0 especially for NULM-SUH  2023If you wish, we can prepare a set of annexures on the policy impacts that we have had in as urban team. The annexures could be in the form of publications, correspondences, and orders.In the proposed request, what are the different levels in the government that IGSSS plans to engage ?In the proposed project, it is expected that the closest engagement will be with the ULBs, and state government. Through the other existing project action and the CSO networking in the proposed there will be engagements with the central level ministries and agencies. The most focus will be with ULBs and state government, ministries and departments.What is the expected timeline of support from Oak beyond the four years' of this request ? what kind of sustainable funding sources does IGSSS have that may be invested in this programme?The request is for 4 years for this project. We are heavily invested in informal workers and urban poor communities and are hoping to continue our key flagship projects of satat shehar & punarnirman for urban poor and informal workers in the coming years. And as a development agency, we have committed to our long-term engagement with urban poor and worker communities as constituency. It is also requested that at least one more cycle of project funding be supported, if possible, by oak with the same constituency to ensure the sustainability of actions and wider impacts.Given the similarity in challenges faced  by informal sector workers in other growing economies such as India, it will be useful to know whether IGSSS will draw examples on  how government and not-for -profits in those countries are dealing with such challenges.Yes, it is something that we are already are embarking upon. Especially exchange with global south countries/ cities and as well as more closely with south Asian / south east Asian partners. As many countries and cities are leading the discourse on climate resilience and we will benefit from working with them. Like Bangladesh for example. We have already established connections with networks there and hope it will help initiating a good exchange of thoughts, policies, experiences and practice.Oak Application Form     29Is there any engagement planned with the National Disaster Management Authority which is yet to fully apply climate-lens in dealing with disasters?Yes, it is planned and included in the scope to broaden the understanding of working on the issue of urban disasters that are ignored as of now. Especially the climate change related ones that are impacting informal workers and urban poor communities. Also, we were part of the NGO coordination group set by NDMA during COVID and contributed to the discussions then. Therefore, hopeful about converting some ideas/ interventions into policies.Given the large number of small and medium-sized entities that employ informal workers, they may find it difficult to adapt the action plans that may require capital investments   would you address this directly/indirectly?Yes, I think there is an increased state support required for recognition of action plans, only through that eventually will entities and/or communities be able to address the challenges faced by them. This intervention proposed by IGSSS is not based on capital investment, but to facilitate that through collectivization and convergence.  But this project may wish to show models/ pilots that might need small supports to communities to facilitate the creation of examples that can be upscaled by the state.",

Our work is rooted in a theory of change built around the power of social movements to leverage systemic changes. It posits that movements based in the grassroots are necessary for social and environmental change because: 1) they represent local agendas and are comprised of the people with the greatest knowledge, experience, and stake in protecting their environment; 2) they have greater moral authority to question and change systems that adversely affect them; and 3) they serve as the roots from which larger movements for social change gain the motivation and inspiration to grow.Global Greengrants Fund was established in 1992, and over nearly three decades has built a decentralised and participatory decision-making model, in which a network of 200 volunteer activist advisors sets our strategies and makes grant recommendations, in addition to accompanying grassroots partners in their work through mentoring and other non-financial support. These advisors, organised in 25 advisory boards, sister funds and strategic partner organisations, are responsible for identifying grassroots actors who are working to change the systemic causes of climate change, environmental destruction and social and economic injustice; and to strengthen these actors through flexible, responsive and strategic funding and accompaniment. This advisory network collectively represents our most powerful asset.Since 1992, Global Greengrants Fund has supported over 15,000 grassroots initiatives around the world, almost 1,000 of them since 2013 through Global Greengrants Fund UK, the younger, independent sister charity and applicant. Globally, between the US and UK sister organisations, we now support 1,000 grassroots groups per year with small grants funding, advisor accompaniment and networking opportunities.Financial year start date (dd/mon):",

(300 words)Global Greengrants Fund was established in 1993 to channel direct funding and support to grassroots civil society actors working for environmental and social justice across the world. We do this through a decentralised, participatory grant-making model in which our network of over 200 expert local advisors identify grassroots movements; channel small, flexible grants funding to them; and provide ongoing mentorship and accompaniment to them as they deliver their self-determined initiatives. In 2013, Global Greengrants Fund UK was registered as an independent charity in England & Wales, with the first staff member joining the organisation in 2016.The global organisation has grown significantly in recent years, and currently funds over 1,000 initiatives per year (including 217 through the UK entity in 2020-21). The UK organisation has grown its revenue and staffing resources substantially, and is on track to exceed $5m income for the current fiscal year.Global Greengrants Funds India Advisory Board was established in 2001 to support grassroots environmental protection and rights-based development work through small grants and advisor mentorship. The Boards work covers a diverse set of issues, from forest rights to water and sanitation, but with a cross-cutting focus on the most marginalised groups, including Adivasi and Dalit communities; women; transgender people; and rural and remote populations. The Oak Foundation has been the Boards longest-term and largest donor since its inception, supporting the Board since 2012. This support from the Foundation has been critical to the Boards evolving strategy: as one of the Boards only funders providing multi-year support, the Oak Foundation has enabled the Board to develop relationships, networks and more in-depth understanding of the specific challenges facing the group it supports.While the growth of our support to grassroots movements is a major achievement of the past two years, the achievement we are most proud of is our advisory networks ability to continue strengthening grassroots movements within the extraordinarily challenging context of Covid-19; in India, with the support of the Oak Foundation, the Advisory Board was able to rapidly mobilise emergency grants to 11 local initiatives on the frontline of Covid response during the countrys deadly second wave, and continues to provide additional support to all its grantees affected by the pandemic as required.Oak Application Form     75c.

(600 words):ContextOver twenty years on since the inception of the Global Greengrants Fund India Advisory Board, marginalised communities in India continue to face a complex, interconnected range of social, environmental, health and rights challenges, all of which have been exacerbated significantly by the immediate and longer-term impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and of the climate crisis.Rural women and marginalised communities, including Adivasis, Dalits and migrant workers, have been disproportionately affected by the immediate health risk from the virus and by the effects of lockdown measures, including loss of income, food insecurity and exposure to violence; an estimated 75 million people in India were pushed into poverty during the first wave of the pandemic alone. The effects of the pandemic have been especially pronounced for the Adivasi communities supported by our Advisory Board; many of the casual labourers who returned to remote rural communities at the beginning of the pandemic have remained there, putting additional pressure on already highly stretched local resources. Logging, mining and other activities harmful to the environment  both officially sanctioned and illegal  have increased, representing a major challenge to communities reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods, food, shelter and medicine, despite the protections set out in the Forest Rights Act.Simultaneously, climate-linked disasters such as Cyclone Tauktae in 2021, flooding and landslides across multiple states particularly including the north-east, and the major heatwave of spring 2022, are destroying the livelihoods of thousands of farming and fishing communities already facing extreme poverty and food insecurity as a result of the pandemic. As well as the immediate threat to lives and property from disasters of this kind, climate change is driving increased water scarcity, crop failure, soil erosion and the loss of biodiversity including fishing stocks.Both before the pandemic and during it, local organisations and movements across India have been the frontline responders to the intersecting health, social and environmental crises they face: identifying local challenges, designing solutions and mobilizing communities to carry them out. Through its grant-making and accompaniment work with emerging civil society actors, the India Advisory Board aims to strengthen these locally-led initiatives, enabling them to become more effective in achieving their self-determined goals while also promoting a rights-based, inclusive approach to social and environmental justice work that is rooted in local agency, autonomy and dignity.This grant-making and accompaniment work is also how we have identified the specific challenges affecting marginalised groups in India: with the support of the Oak Foundation, our advisors have developed an analysis which is rooted in the perspectives and experiences of our grantee partners. Oak Application Form     8The proposed work is informed by this analysis and by Global Greengrants overarching theory of change, which posits that movements based in the grassroots are necessary for social and environmental change because they represent local agendas and are comprised of the people with the greatest knowledge, experience, and stake in protecting their environment; because they have greater moral authority to question and change systems that adversely affect them; and because they serve as the roots from which larger movements for social change gain the motivation and inspiration to grow.Our partnership with Oak Foundation and recent highlightsAs mentioned above, the Oak Foundation has been supporting Global Greengrants Funds India Advisory Board since 2012, with over 200 grassroots initiatives funded and accompanied by our advisors in total through this partnership.In the most recent phase of our partnership  the 2018-22 grant to which this proposed work links directly  we set out the following objectives:1) To support a total of 40-50 grassroots civil society initiatives in Jharkhand and West Bengal with small grants to enable action on environmental justice and climate change, aiming to strengthen their ability to effectively advocate for their rights and implement viable solutions to local challenges; and in the medium to long term, to strengthen their organisational capacity.2) To foster stronger networks among local civil society organizations in Jharkhand and West Bengal, as well as across India, through a series of grantee workshops and through grant-making to network organisations, with the aim of grantees having increased resources including knowledge, skills and financial support to carry out their work.3) To promote womens rights, safety, well-being, and economic security through small grants to women-led and women-focused environmental justice activities (30% of all grant-making), as well as through advisors working with grantees to support the incorporation of a gender lens in their work, with the aim of securing an increased leadership role for women in environmental justice initiatives. Examples of the types of activity supported through this objective include women-led initiatives addressing forest rights and agriculture.During this most recent phase, 55 grassroots initiatives were supported with small grants to implement solutions for environmental justice and in response to climate change. The majority of projects focused on raising awareness of the importance of natural resource conservation, especially for women and youth, and orienting the communities towards organic and sustainable agriculture to improve livelihood opportunities, food security, and health. Projects also focused on strengthening grassroots institutions and local governance, supporting minority groups in obtaining and implementing Community Forest Rights in the context of FRA2006, empowering Gram Sabha, and providing equal access to water and sanitation.Key learnings from this most recent phase of work include:Thirty-one percent of grantees who have reported have been able to access additional funding as a result of the grant provided through the Oak Foundation support. This includes funding from international foundations such as Keystone Foundation, Foundation for Ecological Oak Application Form     9Security, 350.org, Action Aid and AJWS, but also national government administration (e.g. Forest Department of Jhrakhand, NABARD (National Agriculture Bank And Rural Development), Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Agriculture Research Centre), and other national NGOs and international NGOs including MOCICC (Movimiento Ciudadano frente a Cambio Climtico, a Peruvian NGO). In addition, forty-two percent of grantees have told us that thanks to GGFs support, they have been able to benefit from new networking opportunities, increased recognition and trust from the wider community, and general support. In some cases, it was observed that the visibility gained is a gateway to additional funding opportunities.Overall, groups observed a general inclination toward learning from - and helping - each other; forums and district-level meetings were organised to exchange lessons learned, experiences, and best practice. Some organisations have started to hold interactions with district-level NGOs, have been given opportunities to take part in stronger networks with other grassroots groups, and have been invited to join international conferences.Several of the grants made also went to network organisations; for example, one network organisation based in Karnakata is organising a series of twelve national and regional level meetings to develop and present an action plan regarding forest rights to policymakers. Access to these types of networks is critical for many of the grassroots organisations we support, who are often unable to access other sources of information and advice, and are able to share resources and strategies as a result.57% of grants made have been to women-led organisations or to initiatives focused on womens rights, wellbeing, and economic security. Women are more prominently represented in the leadership of their organisation and have been able to develop their leadership skills through the seminars or workshops offered by the projects. In some projects, women's participation grew so much that they now represent one-third of the forest rights committee at the Gram Sabha level, where they often assume prestigious roles (secretariat, presidency, vice-presidency). In some cases, women are taking a crucial role in decision-making and lead the negotiations with local authorities.Eighty percent of the grantees who have reported have said that thanks to the Oak Foundations support they have been able to improve environmental conditions at the local level. Organisations could measure an overall increase in the awareness and responsibility of local communities towards improving environmental conditions and safeguarding natural resources, for example, through the set-up of Forest Rights Committees, Village Forest Management Committees, or through campaigning. Benefits reported by the grantees include: increased wildlife protection; restoration of water channels; farmers shifting to organic agriculture/ agroecology and no longer using chemical fertilisers and pesticides; regeneration of wastelands, and the return of birds, animals, and plant species.Themes in our grant-making to date, and emerging prioritiesOak Application Form     10While the Boards strategy focuses on the most marginalised groups, a number of cross-cutting themes have emerged across its work with these groups across the different geographies within India where it works. The proposed work aims to leverage the Boards existing networks and expertise, and with the support of the Foundation to also develop new approaches, resources and capacity which can make it more effective in addressing these specific themes and challenges. These themes include:Food systems and sustainable agriculture. Food security has become an even more urgent challenge for poor rural communities in the context of both Covid and rising temperatures driven by the climate crisis, with the continuing dominance of industrial agriculture threatening the economic independence of family farmers as well as impacting local biodiversity and soil conservation and acting as a major contributor to carbon emissions. Three of our advisors are specialists in this area, with one living as part of a collective farm run by Adivasi community members. For the proposed work, we anticipate that this theme will continue to be an important one across all of the geographies in India where the Board operates.Access to forest rights, especially for Adivasi communities. The Board has supported multiple Indigenous groups across India to exercise their right to protect, make decisions, and make a living from their traditional forests in the face of extractive interests. Several groups have been supported for a number of years in this work, such as one organisation in Jharkhand (funded by Oak since 2016) working to secure forest rights, survey forest produce and trees, and promote womens involvement in the Gram Sabha. Two of our advisors have strong links to Adivasi community movements and this theme will continue to be prominent in the proposed work.  Addressing the impacts of climate change and industrial pollution on small-scale fishing communities. Fishing communities, like farmers, have been deeply impacted by climate change in India as cyclones hit coastal areas with increasing intensity and frequency and sea level rise changes coastal ecosystems. One group supported by Oak Foundation via Greengrants in West Bengal has been working to restore and protect mangroves in three villages affected by Cyclone Yaas, for example; others are especially focused on building the leadership, organisation, and economic independence of women in fishing communities.Waste and sanitation issues, especially in relation to Dalit women and youth and to transgender people. Waste picking and manual scavenging (cleaning human waste) generally falls on the most marginalised people in India, especially Dalit women and youth who are frequently unpaid and often suffer severe health impacts and abuse; this work is an increasingly prominent theme in the Boards grant-making, and recent grants have supported the organising, education on rights and health, and registration of manual scavengers in informal settlements of Bangalore; another grant has funded work with transgender waste pickers in Kolkata to improve health conditions and connect them to broader environmental justice movements.Oak Application Form     11In the context of the pandemic, the Board has adapted its approach to ensure maximum flexibility and support to groups on the Covid frontlines, including with the support of the Oak Foundation. Our grantee partners have shown enormous resourcefulness and resilience throughout this crisis, whether by adapting existing activities to ensure the safety of community members, or by developing new lines of work such as Covid prevention and awareness activities, providing PPE or addressing the food security implications of the pandemic.The next phase of our partnership with the Oak FoundationAs India begins to move into the post-pandemic recovery phase, the Board is looking ahead to the next phase of its existence and aims to continue scaling up its support to marginalised communities across India, building on the Boards experience to date and also on the findings of the evaluation conducted on the previous phase of our partnership (attached separately).  The strategy for this proposed next phase of our partnership includes, firstly, exploring opportunities to support groups which the Board has had less engagement with to date  whether in new geographies, or those affected by additional dimensions of disadvantage such as trans or intersex identities. With one of the newest Board members from a Dalit background, the Board also aims to deepen its engagement with Dalit and other marginalised communities in the next few years, including by ensuring its own composition reflects that of its grantee partners in terms of gender, age, caste status, religion and geographical background. This need for enhanced focus on Dalit and other marginalised groups is one of the key recommendations of the evaluation of the previous phase of our partnership (see 4.1.3, paragraph 101 and 4.3 in the evaluation).Secondly, the Board aims to strengthen its support to existing partners, recognising there is scope in its work to support emerging civil society to become more established organisations with enhanced capacity to address social and rights challenges and to be more resilient and sustainable in their work. In particular, this includes two changes to the Boards grant-making approach: increasing the size of the average grant made from $7,000 to $10,000; and moving towards providing multi-year funding commitments to trusted partner organisations. This longer-term approach to funding will also strengthen our grantees accompaniment work, enabling advisors to develop their relationships with grantee partners and to support them in becoming more sustainable and effective organisations over time; it follows the recommendation of the evaluation that the Board consider extending the size and duration of grants made (paragraph 4.1.1). These changes will also be complemented and strengthened by the Boards participation in Global Greengrants Funds emerging global learning strategy, which aims to connect the different parts of our global grant-making network more effectively to foster improved learning and communication; in part this also responds to the recommendation in the evaluation that the access of our grantees to expert advice be supported (4.2.1).Finally, whilst individual Advisory Board members usually identify and support grantee partners in a specific state or cluster of states, an important aspect of the Boards strategy for fostering a stronger civil society network in India is to develop and share expertise on these cross-cutting themes across different geographies within India. This is reflected in the grant-Oak Application Form     12making budget lines of the proposed work, which include a split of 60% grant-making for local initiatives in West Bengal, and the remainder for work in other states. We recognise that the Foundations strategy for India is strongly focused on West Bengal, which is a critical state for our advisors work; by requesting some support to be earmarked to other states, our objective is to ensure that grantees participating in grantee workshops and other engagement activities have the maximum opportunities to benefit from the work of allied and aligned civil society organisations across all of India. For example, as mentioned above, in the current phase of our partnership several network organisations based outside of West Bengal have been supported, enabling grantees within West Bengal and outside the state to benefit from resources, strategies and information through this peer support; examples of these organisations include DISHA (the National Fish-workers' Forum); the Save Our Rice Campaign (through PPUS); the Asia Pacific Transgender Network; and the North Bengal Forum of Forest People and Forest Workers (through Bajkul). Our objective is to continue strengthening this wider ecosystem of grassroots peer support with the Foundations support. This approach also follows a key recommendation from the evaluation conducted on the previous phase of our partnership, that supporting strategic networking will be key for improving environmental conditions (see 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 in the evaluation attached separately).Funding contextThe proposed renewal funding from Oak Foundation would represent a major contribution to the India Advisory Boards evolving approach to supporting grassroots civil society in India over the next three to four years. The Advisory Board has continued to be successful in growing its engagement with other funders, including new multi-year commitments from several foundation sources in the UK, Europe and North America; through Global Greengrants Fund UK this includes renewed contributions from Stichting SED Fund and the Human Capability Foundation, as well as portions of larger grant commitments secured in the past six months from three large foundation donors. Cumulatively, the India Advisory Boards annual budget for FY21-22 (closing 30 June 2022) stands at $600,000  a large increase on the initial budget of $332k for the first year of the most recent phase of our partnership in 2018-19. The Advisory Boards budget for FY23 and FY24 is $744,000 per year. (To set this into the wider context of GGF UKs overall financial situation, GGF UKs overall budget is projected at $6.3m for the current fiscal year, and $6.2m for the next fiscal year.)If approved, the currently proposed work would mean that the Oak Foundation would remain a significant funder of the India Advisory Board (though still well below 30% of the total India Advisory Board budget), but within a more diversified portfolio of restricted funders, as well as unrestricted support from Global Greengrants Fund. The global organisation has also significantly grown its unrestricted revenue in the past year, meaning that if the Boards work expands during the reporting period the organisation will be well placed to increase its budget further.The proposed funding would enable the Board to provide 45-60 grants of up to $10,000 per grant to emerging civil society groups in West Bengal and other states in India, including a number of multi-year funding commitments. As well as testing the viability of this new Oak Application Form     13approach, the proposed funding will enable our grassroots partners to directly impact tens of thousands of beneficiaries through their initiatives, and to become stronger, more autonomous and better resourced organisations.With the support of the Oak Foundation, the Global Greengrants Fund India Advisory Board aims to work towards an overarching objective of supporting emerging civil society actors in West Bengal and other states in India to become stronger, more resilient against external shocks, and more effective in carrying out their self-determined activities to address the social, environmental and rights challenges they face. As a result of this work, we expect to see our grantee partners become better connected, resourced and networked; more effective in mobilising community engagement and in ensuring the participation of women, youth and marginalised community members such as Dalits, Adivasis and other disadvantaged groups; and better able to access funding from other sources, decision-making spaces, and media coverage.",

Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.As a result of this work, by the end of the proposed grant period we expect to see local initiatives supported by Global Greengrants Fund being more effective in achieving the immediate and longer-term objectives identified by the grantee partner organisations, with a higher percentage of grantees reporting improvements against a set of eight indicators including increased levels of community engagement, womens leadership, and improved environmental conditions.Grantees assessments of their progress and impact will be collected via our reporting framework and validated by our advisory board members with support from Global Greengrants staff.71.c. Objective 1 Activities and timeframe (bullet points):List in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to to carry out to achieve your expected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and and dont include the full list of every activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant will fund. If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a work plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) Training on movement building for...Building on the previous phases of our partnership with Oak, through the proposed support the members of the India Advisory Board will continue to proactively identify emerging civil society initiatives working towards social and environmental justice outcomes. Prospective grantees will be identified through the advisors existing and new networks within Indian civil society, with advisors approaching new and emerging groups who may not have previously encountered Greengrants or received funding from external funders; advisors will also conduct scoping visits and meetings to understand the strategies and needs of prospective grantees and assess their alignment with Greengrants model and priorities, as well as supporting them to develop funding applications where appropriate (in particular for the most nascent initiatives which may otherwise lack capacity for completing an application). This initial scoping and grantee identification will also reflect the Boards focus on individuals and groups affected by intersecting forms of marginalization (see also Objective 3).Grants will be awarded through meetings of the India Advisory Board, which will continue to meet between three and five times per year to consider applications received against its strategy and criteria, and to award small, flexible grants funding of up to $10,000 per grant, representing an increase from the Boards previous average grant of $7,000 per grant. This higher grant amount is intended to reflect the increased challenges affecting civil society organisations in India with mobilizing resources; to reduce administrative burdens; and to enable local actors to become more effective in planning longer-term initiatives. For this proposed work, this will for the first time include multi-year funding commitments of up to three years for grantees who are known to the Board, and who have the capacity to manage Oak Application Form     15these funds and to become stronger as a result, with the aim of building stronger and more resilient grassroots civil society organisations in West Bengal and the other states in India where grantee partners operate. Our advisors will play a critical role in supporting this capacity development, accompanying organisations to identify and address gaps in their skills, resources and infrastructure; for some (though not all) organisations supported, this will enable them to secure additional funding from external parties, while other movements will have more specific and time-limited goals.60 percent of the projects grantmaking budget will be channeled to groups in West Bengal, and 40 percent to the rest of India and to national networks, to allow facilitation of connections and learning across states, both by funding network organisations and through the work of our advisors to connect grantees working on related challenges across several states.While the specific focus areas and activities of the funded initiatives will be determined by the grantees themselves, with the support of our advisors, it is expected that the following themes and activities will continue to be prevalent in this work, based on the key trends identified under the previous phase of our partnership with Oak:- Issues affecting the rights of Dalit and Adivasi communities and other marginalised groups, such as access to forest rights and government entitlements; participation in Gram Sabhas; and access to water and sanitation. (See also evaluation section 3.3.)- Issues affecting the rights of fishing and forest communities, again including access to the provisions of the Forest Rights Act; food security and agriculture; and the impact of extractive industries and pollution on traditional livelihoods and health.- Climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly in relation to sustainable agriculture and food security and resilience against the effects of climate-linked disasters.- Environmental justice, particularly including advocating for the rights of communities affected by extractive industries and deforestation.- Sustainable development, livelihoods and agriculture- Womens environmental leadership, incorporating an intersectional lens (see objective 3 below), including participation in decision-making spaces, womens leadership of movements and local initiatives, and addressing the rights of trans women, women from Indigenous and Dalit communities, and other women who are affected by multiple dimensions of disadvantage.7.2.a.

Please keep these at a high level and and dont include the full list of every activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant will fund. If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a work plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) Training on movement building for...This objective links to the ambition set out in the previous phase of our partnership with Oak, in which we aimed to deliver a series of annual workshops to connect grantees with each other, to exchange information, resources and learnings, and to foster a culture of mutual support between emerging organisations working on similar issues and challenges. With the pandemic having prevented the workshops scheduled for 2020 and 2021, our goal is to revitalise this work through a series of grantee meetings in West Bengal and other parts of India, which will also incorporate a focus on strengthening organisational resilience in the context of the pandemic and a Oak Application Form     17changing operating environment for many organisations; examples of this could include training sessions on assessing risk, managing regulatory requirements, and standardising operations, depending on the specific needs identified by our advisors in discussion with grantees. By designing workshops based on grantees own identification of their needs in discussion with advisors, our aim (which has been successful in previous years) is to incentivize and support grantee partners to participate in and shape a community of civil society movements that has lasting impact beyond the lifespan of this grant.As with the previous phase of our partnership, a portion of the grantmaking budget will be used to support network and infrastructure organisations working to build capacity for grassroots civil society in India.Our advisors will also continue to provide accompaniment and mentorship to grassroots initiatives, including those funded in earlier stages of our partnership with Oak, as well as newer and emerging civil society initiatives. Advisor accompaniment can include several different types of activity, but is always provided where it is welcomed by grantees and never imposed on them. Examples of the types of support our advisors provide include supporting grantees to identify and tackle specific challenges in implementing their projects; assisting them with developing relationships with key external stakeholders, such as by facilitating introductions to relevant officials or to media spaces; and strengthening leadership, particularly of women, through fostering external connections or participating in capacity-building work, such as identifying resource needs, reviewing a funding strategy or supporting systems strengthening. Both the grantee workshops and the advisor accompaniment will be critical to fostering stronger connections within and between the movements supported by Greengrants, linking disparate actors and influencers and creating collaborative spaces that are informed by grantee partners own priorities and goals.As one of the Greengrants networks largest advisory boards, the board will also play a key role within Global Greengrants evolving learning and evaluation strategy, which includes a focus on disseminating resources, tactics and information across the global network between advisors and grantees working on related issues, but who may otherwise lack opportunities to learn from one another. This includes, for example, connecting advisors and grantees around issues of safety and security, ensuring that they have a good understanding of the mechanisms they can access to support the rights of community members facing threats to their safety, such as through the Environmental Defenders Collaborative (hosted by Global Greengrants Fund); sharing expertise on topics including disability inclusion and trans rights; and exchanging examples of how advisors have been able to support grantees in addressing specific technical or legal issues in their work.  Our advisors in India, as with the rest of our global advisory network, will be supported in this work by the Global Greengrants Fund Programmes team. Subrat Sahu, the Board Coordinator, will continue to liaise with Programmes staff to ensure that the advisors are supported to identify and resolve challenges in their grant-making and other work; as well as linking the Board to Greengrants global learning, evaluation and network-strengthening work. Peer support forms an important part of Greengrants advisory model, and Oak Application Form     18the regular advisor meetings included in the budget will serve as forums for advisors to share their experiences and learnings, troubleshoot, and devise strategies for addressing new challenges.7.3.a. Objective 3 ObjectivesList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals that can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are ambitious but also achievable.  3. Support women and marginalised groups, particularly those affected by multiple dimensions of disadvantage, to access their rights and make decisions about their lives, communities and environments, by embedding an intersectional approach to diversity, equity and inclusion within all of the India Advisory Boards grant-making and accompaniment work.7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected Outcomes (bullet points):What do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here the main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this grant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes describe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some examples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, agency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.As a result of the proposed work, by the end of the grant period we expect to see an increased percentage of organisations and initiatives led by or focused on the rights, perspectives and needs of women, particularly including women who are also affected by disadvantage as a result of other aspects of their identities, for example trans women; Indigenous women; and women with disabilities.73.c. Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (bullet points):List in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to to carry out to achieve your expected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and and dont include the full list of every activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant will fund.

Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) Training on movement building for...This objective directly links to and builds on the goal within the previous phase of Global Greengrants Funds partnership with the Oak Foundation. Gender remains a fundamental component of the India Advisory Boards Oak Application Form     19analysis and strategy; through the proposed work the Advisory Board will seek to further strengthen its support to local initiatives led by women, who continue to bear a disproportionate burden from social and environmental harms, now including the impacts of the pandemic and the increasingly apparent effects of climate change. Overall, we will continue to channel at least 30% of all of our grant-making to initiatives either led by women, or focused on womens rights, safety, wellbeing and socioeconomic status; prioritizing womens leadership in environmental justice movements remains a long-standing strategic objective for Global Greengrants Fund.We will complement and deepen this commitment to strengthening womens rights by also incorporating an explicitly intersectional approach within our grant-making, including channelling greater support to initiatives led by women, LGBTQI+ people and trans people, especially including those who also identify as belonging to other groups which have historically been marginalised, including Dalits, Adivasis, migrant workers, Safai Kamancharis, and members of religious minorities. The India Advisory Board will identify opportunities to explore and learn from the specific challenges of intersectional grant-making in India through the grantee workshops and will also seek to adapt its own practices where necessary to ensure that its grant-making and accompaniment work reflect intersectional approaches and concerns, for example by agreeing that a minimum percentage of grants made will be to initiatives led by women who also identify as Indigenous, Dalit, LGBTQIA, or as having a disability. This is also expected to include work to ensure that the Board includes members whose gender identifications, sexuality, religious affiliations, socioeconomic background, caste status and indigeneity status reflects a diverse range of lived experiences that mirrors those of the Boards grantees, with the objective of ensuring that these grantee partners are supported by our advisors in a way which upholds their dignity and independence.The India Advisory Board will work to address this objective in their work with the support of the Coordinator, Subrat Sahu, and the Greengrants staff Programme team, including Greengrants Director of Gender and Equity, Ursula Miniszewski.",
        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):The most important partners for this work are the Global Greengrants Fund India Advisory Board members; the Boards membership currently comprises five Advisors, including one in West Bengal. The Board is supported by a Coordinator and an Administrator. The Advisors are all experts in their fields Oak Application Form     20with deep connections to local communities and civil society. They are responsible for identifying grassroots actors who are working to change the systemic causes of environmental destruction and social and economic injustice, and work to strengthen these actors through flexible, responsive and strategic funding and accompaniment. Through this model, Global Greengrants and the Advisory Board seeks to ensure that the lived experience of our community grantee partners is central to the social, environmental and rights initiatives the Board supports. Advisors are also themselves deeply embedded in networks of support for grassroots civil society, including through links to Adivasi and Dalit organisations, as well as farmer cooperatives and academia.As in the previous phase of our partnership with Oak, we will continue to work in partnership with other regional and international organisations such as Prospera International Network of Womens Funds as a partner in the Global Alliance for Green and Gender Action, as well as 350.org, Earth Island Institute, International Rivers and Pesticide Action Network. We will also continue to identify other potential partners internationally and within India who are able to support our grantees work, potentially including local philanthropic actors; within India Greengrants already has good connections with intermediaries, philanthropic organisations and implementing organisations including AJWS, Holdeen Foundation, Fund for Global Human Rights, Azim Premji Foundation, and aims to build on and deepen these relationships and others during the proposed grant period. This work will also be supported through Greengrants global fieldbuilding strategy, which seeks to work with existing and emerging philanthropic actors globally to unlock additional resources for grassroots movements; while this global strategy is still nascent we look forward to keeping Oak updated on our progress, and appreciate the input that you are already providing to shape the strategy.",

This incorporates tools including reports from grantees and advisors; grant-tracking systems; grantee surveys; learning exchanges; participatory action research; grant strategy reviews; network mapping; and in-depth regional case studies, to gather information about the impacts of our funding on individual grantee organisations, Oak Application Form     21broader movements, and environmental and social conditions, and evidence of change. In-depth and longitudinal studies help us to map what long-term accompaniment and strengthening of a movement looks like.Each community group in receipt of a small grant and advisor support is asked to report on the progress of the project one year after receipt of the funding. The reporting form asks for assessments and learning related to eight indicators which align with Global Greengrants Funds evaluation framework and help us assess impact:1. Any evidence of improved environmental conditions since receiving funding2. Strengthened organisational capacity3. Increased community awareness or involvement4. Increased involvement of women, youth, and indigenous leaders in the work of the initiative5. Impacts on policy or policy implementation6. Increased media interest in the grantees work, if this is something that the grantee seeks7. Increased access to spaces for decision-making and advocacy and networks8. Increased access to additional funding from sources other than Greengrants, or other forms of support (for example, expertise).In addition, the report asks for a description of what the partner assesses to be the most significant change, any changes in the external environment, and any lessons learned from the work. The reporting process invites our community partners to reflect on their work and draw lessons. Reports also help advisors to analyse trends, inform the strategy-setting, and collate stories of success and learning; this data is collected by the Advisory Boards Administrator with the support of the Coordinator, and analysis is conducted jointly by the entire Advisory Board.The framework set out above is designed to be as flexible and appropriate as possible for Greengrants portfolio of grassroots, emerging civil society groups who are highly likely to lack capacity to conduct monitoring and evaluation activities, and whose aims and approaches vary significantly depending on the local context. Recognising this, Greengrants does not currently provide a more detailed framework for grantee partners to define, for example, parameters for improved environmental conditions; the framework seeks instead to place grantee partners own perceptions, rather than externally imposed definitions, at the core of Greengrants evaluation and learning work.Findings will be reviewed by Global Greengrants Fund staff and discussed with advisors on a regular basis, including during virtual and (where possible) in person meetings, focusing on the impacts of individual and aggregated grants, the challenges our partners face, and wider trends.All advisory boards receive disaggregated data relevant to their grantmaking, to help influence their future strategy-setting and decision-making, and improve the quality of support Global Greengrants Fund provides. For the proposed work, we additionally plan to commission an Oak Application Form     22evaluation in the final 5 months of the grant which will assess progress against the objectives outlined above, particularly including the degree to which the board has been able to incorporate an intersectional approach to its work, and any learnings from this which can be used to strengthen the boards future grantmaking and accompaniment work. We will welcome the input and feedback of the Oak Foundation in developing the terms of reference for this evaluation to ensure that it meets the Foundations expectations, particularly in terms of including grantee partners perspectives.The proposed work also links to Global Greengrants evolving learning strategy. This emerging piece of work, which will also intersect with the organisations ongoing Strategic Journey, aspires to decentralise learning across the Greengrants network and facilitate shared learning between advisors and grantees across disparate geographies and themes. This will also include evaluating the existing monitoring and evaluation framework to identify opportunities for strengthening our approach and developing additional insight that can strengthen our advisors and grantees work; this could potentially include working with our grantees to strengthen their monitoring and evaluation capacity.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):External high-impact risks identified for the proposed work include the ongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on communities with which we work, and on the ability of our advisors to continue their grantmaking and mentoring support. The pandemic has had an enormous impact on our grantees in India: lockdowns and travel restrictions represent a major barrier to frontline community actors ability to campaign, coordinate and build successful coalitions. To mitigate against these challenges, Global Greengrants has carried out several scenario planning exercises throughout 2020-21 to help us navigate the impacts of the pandemic on our partners, and through our advisors we continue to apply maximum flexibility in our support to the activists and communities we work with.Another external risk to highlight is the increasing frequency and severity of threats to environmental defenders across the world. Global Greengrants is managing this risk by providing rapid, flexible and discreet emergency funding to environmental defenders at risk identified by our advisory boards in Africa. We also house the Environmental Defenders Collaborative (EDC), a pooled fund of 14 funders, which supports environmental activists by Oak Application Form     23increasing access to funding and strategic resources. We further work with other actors in the environmental space to increase understanding and implementation of prevention and protection strategies, including in partnership with the Funders Initiative for Civil Society. Within India, we will continue to ensure that all the work supported complies with the requirements of the FCRA and all other relevant laws and regulations.Internally, one risk with potentially major consequences is the risk of advisors lacking capacity to deliver their work and / or facing burnout through stress, especially given the highly challenging external context and the impact this is likely to have on advisors. To mitigate this, Greengrants is investing in an organisation-wide Organisational Care Initiative (OCI), currently being led by independent consultant Ishita Chaudhry, and which will be coordinated by our new Director for People & Culture (starting September 2022). The OCI aims to minimise the risk of staff burnout but also to actively promote a culture of care across the wider network, including among our advisors. The work of our Learning Consultant, Mateo Martinez Abarca, who is responsible for delivering our learning strategy and ensuring our advisors are connected with learnings and insights from across our advisor network, will also be key in mitigating this risk.Global Greengrants Fund UK also maintains a risk register which has identified key governance, compliance, financial, external and operational risks as well as mitigation measures. The charitys trustees regularly identify and review the major risks to which the organisation is exposed. Both manual and automated checks are regular invoked, particularly those relating to the operations and finance of the charity, including through a finance sub-committee of the Board, chaired by the Treasurer, which is responsible for financial governance and risk management.In addition to managing these internal and external threats, Global Greengrants Fund UK has in place a safeguarding policy, and jointly with our network-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion working group has developed an internal code of conduct which aims to enable individuals engaged with Global Greengrants to uphold and safeguard the dignity, freedom and liberty of all people, in line with our commitment to developing and strengthening an enabling environment, and a culture of communication, trust and empathy, where the health, safety and the dignity of all persons associated with our organisation, directly or indirectly, is given primacy.",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONSPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak programme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. There was mention of several of GGFs grantees maturing to the next level of funders, can you provide exact information on how many and Oak Application Form     24how much funding have been leveraged by the grantees independently and/or with GGFs support?27% of our grantees supported by the Oak Foundation have reported that with Global Greengrants support they have been able to access additional funding. Grantees have been able to secure funding from sources including Association for Indias Development; ActionAid; The Asia Foundation; Both ENDS; UNICEF; Millenium Alliance; Paul Hamlyn Foundation; Keystone Foundation; Oxfam India; and others.Our grantees typically havent reported on the specific amount of funding leveraged from other sources, but the information that we have received indicates the following:Unspecified amount from Bosu Bigan Mandir for indigenous people development.Unspecified amount from Yuva Manthan Sanstha.Unspecified (small) amount from government administration to train youth members for a livelihoods initiative.Unspecified small grant from Foundation for Ecological Society for capacity building of community forest rights management committees at the district level.INR10,00000 from Keystone Foundation.Unspecified additional funding to address the problems of food insecurity due to COVID-19: from APPI for ration distribution in the Barwadih block of Latehar; from UHHIP to distribute rations in the Bargarh, Bhandariya and Ranka block of Garhwa and from NCDHR to distribute rations in the Mahaudand block of Latehar.Unspecified amount from AJWS for collaboration to further strengthen the work of the campaign.Unspecified individual donations for things like construction of drinking water wells, distribution of clothes, and solar lights distribution etc.In addition, 23% of our grantees support by the Oak Foundation have reported that with Greengrants support they have benefited from new networking opportunities and increased recognition from the wider community. Organisations have been able to create more linkages with like-minded change players and access opportunities for further engagement and dialogue on issues pertaining to partnerships, collaborations, and funding. This boosted organisations' capacity for knowledge-sharing and increased opportunities to access similar projects and mobilise government schemes for action. Organisations also benefited from increased recognition and appreciation, exemplified by an increase of positive views towards the grantees from the broader community. For instance, two organisations were consulted by the national government and a UK-based organisation to provide specialised pieces of training and knowledge on issues such as human trafficking, millet cultivation, and livelihood systems.Given the ten-year long relationship with Oak, it will be good to know the significant accomplishments/lessons drawn over these years. In other words, information on the impact GGF could make and the changes brought about since their time of their association with Oak.Oak Application Form     25The funded work has strengthened individual organisations and the overall civil society in India. Although not all have been able to access additional funding from elsewhere, many have, and the majority report strong relationships within and outside their communities and with organisations and individuals carrying out similar work in other regions. Through the networks they are a part of, grantees have been able to engage with state and national level bodies regarding forest rights, food security, and fishing rights.The annual meetings arranged by Greengrants are a source of expert knowledge, in addition to being eagerly awaited solidarity events. The sources of the expert advice vary  from networks that they are part of (civil society, social movements) to academia and think tanks.  The critical support provided by Greengrants is instrumental in access to more network meetings which are a source of information and knowledge. Some organisational grantees are themselves experts in their own fields (and are recognised as such by the state) and provide expert advice to the community (from accessing entitlements, to access to larger networks, to plantations). While it has not been possible to carry out these meetings during the pandemic years, we are now starting to hold workshops again and look forward to sharing the outcomes of these with the Foundation.The vast majority of grantees report that they have been able to make a tangible difference to their local environments thanks to the support of Greengrants and the Oak Foundation. There is a huge range of environmental improvements, from nurseries to organic farming led by transgender people, to forest and mangrove protection and rejuvenation.In all cases, communities are increasingly involved in and aware of the issues facing them and the initiatives to combat them. Their skills and knowledge are increasing, and they have a strong understanding of the means at their disposal. For example, some are using the Right to Information Act (RTI) 2005 to get information and engagement with the state. In some of the forest villages in Jharkhand, they were conversant with even the nuances of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, (popularly FRA), and used mapping for claiming rights.The issues that the grantees are engaged with (livelihoods, forest rights, indigenous concerns, LGBTQIA+ rights, and access to urban housing and water) are being covered more in the media.Almost all the groups in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh work with the indigenous peoples. Other marginalised communities covered are small scale traditional artisanal fish workers (Maharashtra and West Bengal), farmers (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu), and trans-persons (West Bengal).Most of the grantee organisations were women majority or women oversaw the project. One organisation was transwoman-led, and majority trans-person. Women were articulate and present in substantial numbers during most grantee field visits by our evaluator. In a few cases, women were a majority. In some cases, the women were more articulate even when outnumbered by men. The focus on livelihoods, housing, water, and womens empowerment enables the participation of women even in adverse Oak Application Form     26circumstances. These are legitimate basic rights and entitlements that can, most times, still rise above divisive local politics.There has been formal recognition and inclusion in state decision making/ consultative processes for some of the grantees at the local (village, gram panchayat) level. One grantees work has been promoted as a model by the district administration. The networks that grantees are part of (right to food) have been able to influence policy even at the union level  a significant achievement in the present environment.How the mentoring helped organisations to create opportunities for sustainability strategies, including through securing other funding, developing alternative income sources, or scaling up their solutions.See above re other funding secured. The other way in which opportunities have been created for increased sustainability is through the general strengthening of networks and movements as a whole; organisations and individuals are able to share learning, information and strategies as outlined elsewhere in this proposal.",

Summarise the projects ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)The projects ultimate goal is to improve the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes of young women and adolescent girls of Jharkhand and West Bengal by creating a sustainable model of community empowerment and youth responsive SRH services in the public health system. Ipas Development Foundation (IDF) will be Ipass lead partner in implementing the project. The project addresses multiple components of a sustainable abortion ecosystem taking a comprehensive approach to reduce barriers and improve health and lives of the most vulnerable and marginalized populations. Our approach utilizes a range of efforts with an eye on innovations and sustainabilityawareness building among individuals, sensitization of families and communities, health system strengthening, local advocacy for action and support, state-level engagement for ownership, and national-level initiatives for policy and legislation. All our current strategies are adapted within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic so that they are both feasible to implement and designed to meet community needs. Leveraging IDFs strong partnership with the state governments, the project will strengthen the availability, quality, and utilization of SRH services by young women and girls. The complementary health system strengthening efforts, including in Sundarbans, will be supported by IDFs core funds.",

        "5. ORGANISATION CONTEXT": "6. Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, governance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Founded in 1973, Ipas is a pioneering global health and rights organization focused on amplifying, defending, and advancing access to safe abortion and contraception. We work in 29 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to shape the sustainable abortion ecosystemthe context around an individual who seeks to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Ipas is governed by an 18-Grant Application Form, July 1 20135member international Board of Directors of international professionals, medical providers, and academics in the fields of health, SRH, and finances. The board includes an Executive Committee, Finance and Investment Committee, Audit and Risk Committee, and other committees that set policies and review and approve Ipass long-term plans and annual organizational budgets. Board officers are Sandeep Prasad (Chair and former Executive Director of Action Canada for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights), Monica Oguttu (Vice Chair and Executive Director, Kisumu Medical and Education Trust), Trish Karlin (Treasurer and Executive Vice-President of Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation), and Carlos Plazas (Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of Planned Parenthood of Maryland). Senior leadership provides strategic and management leadership to Ipas staff. Directors and Managers of Ipass regional and country programs design, implement and monitor programs, and Directors of technical and operational departments support technical innovation, development, and administrative functions.   Ipas is defining and implementing a system of shared leadership that shifts more power and some central functions to our country teams. The Ipas Country Directors are leading on planning and implementing an Ipas Road Map to start using the shared leadership approach. An example of this shift is the lead staff for our Quality-of-Care work across the world, is based in Kenya. This organizational shift is part of Ipass commitment to break down harmful power structures, particularly the neo-colonialism present in so many INGOs and global health organizations headquartered in the global north. 6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Ipass FY22 organizational budget anticipates annual operating costs of USD 42,240,000. We have confirmed support from European governments (including from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), the Canadian government, and many private US foundations. The structure of funding varies by grant award or contract, with many multi-year grants, some one-year grants, and contracts with partners to perform scopes of work or collaborate on projects. Ipass foundation and government grants are a combination of core and restricted funding, with approximately 30% for core funding. In addition, Ipas has an individual and major gifts program that exceeded its annual goals since 2020. We have estimate reserves totalling USD 49,031,000 and no debt. The largest change in Ipass financial situation is due to changes in strategy of our large anonymous donor (LAD) that began in 2020 that negatively impacted Ipass budget as well as those of other INGOs dedicated to sexual and reproductive health and right (SRHR)support from LAD changed from $29.9 million in FY20 to $13.2 million in FY21 and has resulted in an organization restructure of our US office, including a staff reduction (41 positions). Leadership worked to streamline operations, combining some departments and subcontracting out some Grant Application Form, July 1 20136information technology functions. This has required scaling down and re-planning programming, and we are being mindful to carefully navigate these shifts to preserve critical safe abortion programming, as we also improve collaboration with partners. We have been moderately successful at increasing funding from some of our existing donors and identifying new sources of funding. IDF was one of the recipients of a multi-country grant from LADwithdrawal of support from LAD negatively impacted IDFs operating budget by 40%. Like Ipas, IDF also mitigated this through strategic resizing and program changes and has now successfully secured additional funds to overcome the impact of this and continue efforts to improve the abortion ecosystem in its program states and at the national level.  6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Ipas has worked for nearly 50 years to ensure that women and girls have improved access to safe abortion and contraceptive care, which we consider crucial for improved reproductive rights, health, and gender equality. Our efforts on four continents have improved SRHR for women living within a range of restrictive abortion settings. Areas of expertise include implementing evidence-based initiatives to improve safe abortion access with governments, health providers, and community organizations, expanding health workers capacity and commitment to provide abortion care, and conducting action-oriented research to advance reproductive rights, with a focus on centering the perspectives and needs of those seeking abortion care. Guided by a commitment to human rights, innovation, and sustainability, we are skilled at building relationships with diverse stakeholders at every level of society, including within governments, institutions, and communities. Ipas Development Foundation (IDF) is Ipass implementing partner is India. IDF began work in India in 2001 to address the SRH needs of Indian women and girls, specifically to reduce the incidence of unsafe abortion which continues to be the third major cause of maternal mortality. IDFs presence in 10 states and women-centered approach ensures that women and girls have improved knowledge, agency, and access to SRH care, including abortion and contraception. Partnerships with governments to achieve sustainability has resulted in: sustainable allocation of resources to support abortion care; consistent availability of essential equipment and supplies; increased numbers of trained providers to provide high quality care; and strengthened national policies and technical standards and guidelines to support a strong national abortion care program. As a result of IDFs interventions, training, and advocacy, over 2,000,000 women and girls have accessed services from over 5,000 public health care facilities (with over 84% of these at the primary level). IDFs interventions in Jharkhand and West Bengal in previous projects supported by the Foundation have resulted in positive outcomesparticularly in improving SRH knowledge among young women and girls, increasing service utilization and greater recognition of SRH as an important health issue (please see Annexure 1). Grant Application Form, July 1 20137In Jharkhand, the endline evaluation shows statistically significant improvement in overall SRH indicators for knowledge, attitude, practices as well as stigma reduction, with the range of variation higher in the intervention group than in the comparison area  the findings are supported by an upward trend in SRH service uptake in public health facilities. In West Bengal, qualitative assessment of our intervention reveals an overall positive impact in improving SRH of adolescent girls (10-14 years) and young women (15-24 years)adolescent girls and young women reported increased confidence and ability to discuss SRH issues and facility records show increase in utilization of SRH services in intervention facilities. While the results are encouraging, there is a continued need for nurturing an overall enabling environment for adolescent and youth SRH in the two statessome specific gap areas are mentioned in 6e.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Ipass programmatic strategy is based on the Ipas Strategic Framework which was rolled out in FY20. Ipass Strategic Framework offers a vision and strategy for progress on abortion access and rights that lead to programs that are fully grounded in the local contexts of the countries in which we work. Ipass Strategic Framework is based on our model for a sustainable abortion ecosystem. Ipas defines the sustainable abortion ecosystem as a dynamic condition in which resilient local stakeholders and systems are actively accountable and committed to abortion rights and responsive to everyones abortion needs. Ipass Sustainable Abortion Ecosystem model recognizes that a single approach (legal reform, health system strengthening, community education and engagement) will not alone create real access for women and girlsthe full ecosystem needs to be addressed. Using a human-centered approach with women at the center, our approach acknowledges that sustainable abortion care requires flexibility and prioritization on how to collaborate with partners to achieve goals, and how to strike a delicate balance across many factors. Our ecosystem model and strategic framework recognize that sustainable abortion care must be driven by local stakeholders and address multiple programming components to meet womens abortion needs. The Sustainability Framework identifies eight programming components that must be understood for each local context to accurately assess needs, develop and implement strategies, and monitor effective interventions. Underpinning the Strategic Framework is a continued commitment to a human rights and gender equality. Ipas articulates our work within a human rights analysis, and we partner across movements to advance the bodily integrity of all people.6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):Young Indian women and girls face tremendous challenges and stigma in meeting their SRH needs and the COVID-19 pandemic has made accessing information, counselling and support, and services even more difficult. Young girls who marry Grant Application Form, July 1 20138early are more likely to experience extreme social pressure of proving fertility and bear their first child before their body is ready for childbearing. As per latest NFHS-5 (2019-20), 42% of young women in West Bengal aged 20-24 years got married before the legal minimum age of 18 years, while among men around 20% aged 25-29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 years (IIPS 2020).  A similar trend is observed in the intervention district of 24 Parganas (South)42% got married before 18 years (IIPS 2020). The situation is somewhat similar in Jharkhand. As per NFHS-4 (2015-16), 38% of women aged 20-24 years got married before the legal minimum age of 18 years, while among men around 31% men aged 25-29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 years. Early marriage further leads to high teenage pregnancyin West Bengal 16% of women ages 15-19 years were already mothers or pregnant at the time of survey, this was 13% in 24 Parganas (South). Given these, young women constitute 30% of total maternal mortality in the country. The highest maternal deaths (34%) in India are also recorded for young women ages 20-24 years (RGI 2019). More than 33% of the disease burden and almost 60% of premature deaths among adults can be associated with behaviour or conditions that began or occurred during adolescence (GoI 2014). Ipass partner in India, IDF, implements community-focused interventions in Jharkhand and West Bengal to address this, while also addressing specific gaps that were revealed during the evaluation of the previous grant. JharkhandIDFs work under previous grants from the Foundation has yielded positive outcomes (please see Annexure 1); however, some key gap areas from the previous grant include:  1) Womens agency around SRH-related decision making, negotiation skills with family members, and personal mobility is limited2) Socio-cultural barriers including gender norms that impede womens self-efficacy for SRH3) Men involvementIDFs work through male youth leaders has improved mens attitudes towards womens SRH needs and interspousal communication, but more work is needed to improve their acceptance of contraceptives and strengthen their ability to support their spouses in negotiating SRH discussions within families/communities4) Need to decentralize SRH services for improved access Opportunities:Strong foundation for a favourable SRH ecosystem established in the communityCommunity-based evidence to guide strategies on addressing continuing SRH gaps and evolving needs of young womenhealth system interventions for holistic impact (through separate IDF funds) Challenges:Grant Application Form, July 1 20139Potential government COVID-19 restrictionsResistance from the community due to fear of the pandemic West Bengal (WB) existing intervention areasThe often-overlooked SRH needs of adolescents and young women  particularly young adolescents (10-14 years)  are unique and critical, as early intervention lays the foundation for positive SRH outcomes. IDFs targeted, age-appropriate SRH community outreach has led to encouraging results; (please see Annexure 1) while also revealing some gaps:1) Support for SRH and improved communication within family  especially men (spouses), mothers of adolescent girls and mothers-in-law of married young women2) Need to foster community-level support systems for sustaining a positive SRH ecosystem3) Need to sensitize and strengthen the public health system for continued provision of adolescent/ youth-friendly services, especially to unmarried young girls, and for provision of services closer to the communities at lower-level facilities. Opportunities:IDFs ongoing memorandums of understanding with the government of WB for increasing access to comprehensive abortion and contraceptive servicesInitiation of contraceptive services at Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs)Established rapport with the community, health facilities and Anwesha counsellors Challenges:COVID-19 restrictions and government regulations may hamper the pace of proposed workLegal barriers to providing SRH services for adolescentsSchool shutdowns hampering outreach to adolescents West Bengal  Sundarbans (proposed new intervention areas)The Sundarbans region is characterized by poverty, chronic deprivation and acute suffering from climatic adversities. Communities are hard to access and economically vulnerable and ensuring access to basic healthcare services is challenging. Access to SRH  especially for adolescents  is not a priority and existing SRH services are insufficient. This project intends to build awareness on fundamental SRH topics among young women, sensitize communities on the importance of SRH, expand service availability, and strengthen linkages to enable access and improve care-seeking pathways. Opportunities:IDFs ongoing interventions in selected health facilities and good rapport with relevant officialsGrant Application Form, July 1 201310Huge need and scope for improving SRH awareness and service availability for young women and adolescent girls Challenges:The project may require approvals from several departments, including health, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) etc.Unavailability of health workers/counsellors/doctors for trainingLack of acceptance from the community due to low priority to SRH compared to more essential needs, including livelihood/employment",

CooperationDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks and explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 words):As Ipas's lead partner in India, IDF will implement the project with state-based NGOs, contributing to sustained capacity building and community-level ownership for SRH. In two other states  Bihar and Uttar Pradesh  IDF mentors a voluntary network of state-based CSOs to drive local advocacy and action and strengthen the grassroot SRHR movement. These partnerships have been crucial for IDFs learning  they have revealed how mentoring local NGOs can generate impactful community-based evidence and lead to successful advocacy with local authorities. This complements IDFs work of health system strengthening, community outreach and evidence-based policy making. At the national level, IDF is part of various networks, like the Pratigya Campaign and closely works with a range of partners, and academic and professional organizations on SRH issues. These partnerships allow a two-way exchange of experiences and learnings to improve SRH in the country. IDF also benefits from close international associations that expose the organization to global learnings that we leverage for our on-the-ground efforts. In the proposed project, IDF will explore learning partnerships with relevant organizations on social aspects, including the proposed collaboration for creating sustainable supply of low-cost sanitary napkins. Ipas will contribute expertise and global resources to develop IDFs capacities especially around emerging concepts and methodologies related to agency-building and changing social norms in communities. IDF will also explore collaboration with partners, like CREA, for sharing of resources and internal skill building. In West Bengal, IDF will explore networking and alignment with other Oak Foundation grantees, particularly FPAI to ensure synergies and complementarity.     As mentioned in Objective 3, the project aims to expand IDFs work in the Sunderbans region. IDF will gain enhanced understanding about the challenges and needs of the region  including through secondary research  and explore learning collaborations with other relevant grantees of the Foundation.Grant Application Form, July 1 201321",

EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):Ipas will monitor the progress and efficacy of facility-based interventions through routine data collection from all intervention health facilities, including HWCs, in both Jharkhand and West Bengal. Monitoring data will be collected and analyzed to review: trends of utilization of SRH services; age-disaggregated data of young women and girls receiving services, including abortion; referral support provided, and quality of services offered. Results will be shared with providers, community intermediaries, and youth leaders for continued improvement in quality of information and service provision to young women. We will also conduct joint analysis sessions with service providers to transfer data-related skills of data disaggregation and analysis. Field-level monitoring of community outreach work will be led by the state-based Program team in close collaboration with the youth leaders and their supervisors  the teams will conduct quarterly meetings to review data on community meetings and outreach activities, assess progress, and modify strategies as required. In existing intervention areas, pre- and post-exit interviews with young women accessing SRH services at intervention facilities will reveal the perception of quality of services by adolescents and young women and attributes of accessing SRH services at public health facilities. Community-based endline assessments will demonstrate the impact of our community outreach in improving the overall ecosystem for SRHR (scope and methodology to be decided by the end of Year One). In new intervention areas in West Bengal, community-level evaluations will examine the initial effectiveness of our interventions. Using a quasi-experimental design baseline research will assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards SRHR issues, as well as agency and gender equity-related aspects among young women. Partners of young married women will also be surveyed to assess their role. In addition to setting benchmarks for selected output indicators, the baseline study will help identify barriers and facilitating factors to SRH services. In contrast, the end-of-grant research will assess initial effectiveness of the intervention for refining future strategies.Grant Application Form, July 1 201323",

(maximum 300 words):Learnings from the project will significantly contribute to Ipass and IDFs organizational knowledge and influence future strategies, including organization strategic planning to be initiated in early 2022. More specifically, this grant will greatly influence IDFs technical priorities and future fundraising capacity. Work under the previous grants from the Foundation has significantly expanded IDFs technical expertise and resources for community outreach for young women  adolescent and young womens SRH is now one of IDFs key thematic areas of work. The proposed grant will further augment IDFs organizational learning and generate evidence on additional concepts  especially enhancing agency of women, facilitating gender-equitable norms and nurturing a supportive environment for young womens and adolescent SRH. The proposed community-based work in the Sunderbans closely aligns with IDFs priorities around reaching the most marginalized populations and will lay the foundation for future work in the region. Along with support from the Oak Foundation, IDF continues to benefit from diverse donor support, including from Ipas Inc., Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Grand Challenges Canada and AmplifyChange. IDFs projected organizational budget for FY22 is 6 million. To broaden their donor funding base, IDF is now increasingly focused on raising domestic funds; IDF has recruited a Director of Corporate Partnerships who will join the organization in September 2021. The work under the proposed grant is critical for IDFs fund-raising plans  we believe that work on this key component will have maximum traction with donors in India and will therefore be in the forefront of IDFs domestic fund-raising efforts.

(300 words):The Fund was founded in 2002, initially with a registered office in the US and then in the UK in 2013. Until late 2020 the Fund was led by its founding CEO, Regan Ralph, who stepped down after 20 years of inspirational leadership. In May 2023 the Funds new CEO, Gabriela Bucher, joined. During this leadership transition the Funds Deputy CEO, Brandee Butler, has been Acting CEO. The Funds leadership team is currently five members who collectively provide leadership and guidance to over 60 full-time Fund staff based all over the world.  Our Program staff are based in the regions where we have a program presence. In addition, each regional program has a part-time or full-time consultant based in a different priority country who serves as an essential member and key advisor within the team.The Funds global board of directors currently has eighteen members, and is comprised of high-profile human rights experts, frontline activists and committed human rights grant-makers and donors.  Board terms are three years, and the Funds bylaws state that the Board cannot include more than five directors who have served over three terms.  According to the Funds by-laws, at least one-third of the board members must be of or from the regions served.  The Funds board meets in person twice a year and virtually twice a year, and additionally has several standing board committees that meet throughout the year. As required by law, the Funds UK entity also has a small board of trustees which also sit on our global board.The Fund is committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion within our organization. We strive to maintain a board and staff that are reflective of the diversity of its work. We value diversity in all its forms  of thought, background, identities, and lived experience  in the composition of our teams and our recruitment of new staff. Specifically in relation to advancing race equity, in recent years the Fund has made concerted efforts to further diversify its board and leadership team, one example being that during the process of hiring our new CEO the Fund deliberately worked with a global recruitment consultancy to support us in our search, with a priority focus on candidates who would bring race diversity to our leadership. 5b.

Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)The Fund is well positioned to remain a critical funder and ally to activists, groups and movements on the frontlines of human rights struggles in the region. The Fund began working in India in 2003, choosing to focus on the human rights dimensions of poverty and funding a combination of national and state-level groups that worked with the most marginalized populations (Dalits, Oak Application Form     6Tribals, informal sector workers and women across all marginalized groups). Since then, the Fund has disbursed nearly $20million in grants to around 200 groups across India. Over the years, with Fund support, these grantees have made a significant impact on the human rights landscape in areas such as land rights, labor rights, and sexual rights, and in particular for extremely marginalised communities (Dalits, Tribals, etc.). The Fund typically supports a strategic cohort of 35-45 groups in India with an annual budget of roughly $1.2million. When strategic funding opportunities arise we are able to expand our grantmaking portfolio and reach, as our previous support from Oak has enabled us to do.The Funds India Program currently has a grantmaking portfolio of around 40 grantees, including a few groups based outside of India who are some of the most impactful actors able to advance international advocacy and media efforts as those based in India simply cannot due to the security risks and hostile environment.Our three key achievements related to our India programming include:1.The Fund remains a key ally and lifeline to activists: the Fund is now one of a few human rights funders still able to work in India and channel resources to the grassroots level, in part due to our deliberate efforts to operate under the radar and with grantee security and confidentiality remaining our top priority. In the context of India, this is a major achievement. The Funds critical support to frontline activism includes our continuing support to the Legal Defense Fund, one of the only mechanisms of its kind in India  created to provide urgent resources to HRDs and organizations in emergency situations in India, especially related to cases of criminalization. This unique rapid response fund was set up four years ago in collaboration with Holdeen and American Jewish World Service, first incubated at the Fund and for security reasons now housed at the Robert Kennedy Centre in Washington DC. Requests for support are peer reviewed by leading activists. In the last three years almost 70 HRDs at risk have received emergency grants through this initiative for urgent legal assistance, emergency medical care, relocation, etc. Almost 70% of HRDs supported so far by this mechanism have been those working on environmental issues. 2. A major priority of the Funds programming in India is to support newly formed grassroots groups who are able to use the flexible, general support funding we provide to build a strong foundation for their work. For some, our funding  often seed grants  can be transformational. The majority of Fund grantees in India are also led by those who are from the same constituency that they work with (including women, Dalit, Muslim and Adivasis). The Fund strives to support activists and groups working innew and creative ways to advance human rights and social justice and to broaden their constituencies, in particular to youth. For example, the Funds support has extended to activists using arts and culture to help shift public narratives, such as in 2018 we partnered with Marathi YouTube channel BhaDipa and the media and arts collective Maraa. Together, we Oak Application Form     7helped underrepresented voices break into Indias booming stand-up comedy scene. On our 16-city tour of Maharashtra, comics from some of Indias most marginalized communities shared their personal stories, laughs, and important messages of social change with new audiences across the state. Another example is the Funds recent support to a collective of artists (incl. painters, writers and actors) that are working to amplify the voices of marginalized communities affected by the climate crisis and environmental hazards and to raise awareness on and mobilize community-led ecological conservation. This includes a cultural festival on World Water Day, and community -led cleaning of the Nonadaanga pond - a part of the East Kolkata Wetland under threat from urbanization which is the only Ramsar site in the world whose rich biodiversity has the ability to recycle the citys sewage into profitable agriculture and fishing that could help feed the city at low cost.5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Problem AnalysisThe consequences of climate change in India - including eroding coastlines, destroyed ecosystems, catastrophic weather events and poorly designed climate mitigation and development projects - are deepening existing inequalities. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and populations in India that already are vulnerable because of factors such as geography, poverty, gender, indigenous or minority status, national or social origin, birth or other status, and disability, continue to face its harshest effects. The nexus of the climate crisis and socioeconomic and political inequalities is at the root of various types of climate injustices in India, and this is particularly pertinent in the state of West Bengal.West Bengal is a very unique state in India that is still grappling with the effects of its contested history under British rule, and the post-independence political and economic stagnation that followed after years of being one of the richest regions in the world. Today, West Bengal has a fragile economy and is one of the poorest regions in India, attributed, in part, to years of communist rule that shunned industrialization and modernization, and the growing effects of extreme weather  such as flooding  that together are leaving many families destitute and are driving people to migrate to other states. Yet at the same time, West Bengal is home to some of the richest biodiversity and natural resources in India, including pristine forests with diverse fora and fauna, much of which have been carefully preserved and protected by tribal communities and other forest-dwelling communities who have lived there for centuries and are highly dependent on the forest for their livelihoods and food sovereignty.However, West Bengals ecology and pristine forests, as well as the lands, livelihoods, culture and identity or the many indigenous communities that reside in them are increasingly under serious threat from a growing turn Oak Application Form     8towards major investments in development, natural resource extraction and highly urbanized practices. One of the recent examples is the proposed Deocha-Panchami- open cast coal mining project of West Bengal State which supports the eviction of many communities. Furthermore, whilst there are solid laws in India to protect the community rights of indigenous groups, as well as the land they inhabit  such as the Forest Rights Act (FRA)  implementation of these laws remains poor, and recent amendments in laws related to forests and the environment at both state and central government level have been contradictory and difficult for communities and civil society to predict and respond to. Majoritarian governance is also eroding constitutional democracy and the rule of law, and disempowering communities. Recent policies and actions have supported corporate mining and other interests, such as in 2021, Indias Ministry of Environment issued an order to help some mining projects avoid public environment clearance hearings which are a critical tool for good governance and an important process for mining-affected communities, who may be suffering from non-compliance of mandatory environmental safeguards in mining projects. Indias Wildlife Protection Act has also been responsible for the large-scale relocation of tribal communities, and an increased criminalization of forest communities, as documented in this recent report by Centre for Police Accountability.This deeply concerning trend is intensifying and happening within a broader context of civic space and activism being severely curtailed across India as the state seeks to silence all dissent; today, India is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a human rights defender (HRD), especially for those advocating around environmental issues who are easily labelled as threats to national security. The Funds Response & LearningThe Funds work related to environmental issues in India is currently focused in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal and more recently expanded to Chhattishargh and Jharkhand. However, the Fund has deepened its strategic focus and investment in West Bengal in recent years considering the needs on the ground and the critical window of opportunity the current moment presents in this state as it is on the cusp of major development and greater demands on its land and natural resources. The Fund knows that in the face of these growing threats it is imperative that local communities, particularly indigenous and forest-dwelling communities, be supported now to elevate their voices and power to demand their constitutional rights to land and access to natural resources, before private sector interests and deforestation take hold.Over the last few years, thanks to Oaks support, the Fund supported a number of community-led efforts in West Bengal to promote and protect the rights of indigenous and forest-dwellers affected by environmental issues, large development projects, land displacement, and forced evictions. We have gathered important learning about the most effective strategies to help counter and navigate the growing threats outlined above, which have informed our strategic priorities in the years ahead and for which we are seeking Oaks continued support and partnership.Oak Application Form     9As many climate solutions are inextricably linked to social and economic justice in India, the Fund has supported advocacy and lobbying efforts with the government to ensure indigenous communities identities and culture are protected, as well as on promoting food sovereignty and sustainable agricultural practices.From our experience we have learnt that climate change can be mitigated, and environmental justice facilitated when communities are economically resilient, women have equal and equitable access to resources and to power, younger people feel stronger community connectedness, and citizens are collectivized and have the knowledge of laws and policies that impact them and their environment.The Fund is pleased to report that through Oaks current grant for work in Jhargram, West Bengal, local groups and activists have made significant in their work over the last few years, and the results of this are extremely encouraging, and on which we are seeking to build. Over the last few years:Targeted communities in Jhargram, Purulia and Bankura have demonstrated increased capacity to self-organize and claim their community/individual forest rights.Perhaps most notably, at the time of writing this, up to now communities have been supported to form 15 Gram Sabhas - 9 in Nayagram Block and 6 in Binpur II Block - and so far 8 are in the process of claiming community forest rights, with others are in the process of preparing their claims for submission. These 8 claims in process represent the rights of a total of 584 families and land 1,597 hectares in size, which demonstrates the huge reach and potential impact of community-level institutions like Gram Sabhas and their collective action.Another inspiring outcome has also been that some leaders of Gram Sabhas took initiative to form a platform/network of local Gram Sabhas - Banadhikar Gram Sabhas Mocha  which has since held two annual convenings of local Gram Sabhas, involving local leaders and forest rights activists from a number of villages. The last convening, held earlier in 2023, was attended by 200 people which demonstrates the appetite for such platforms and spaces. The convening included rich discussions. Banadhikar Gram Sabhas Mocha has also been able to successfully liaise with and advocate with the District Magistrate and other District officials in instances where Gram Sabhas claims are not being responded to, helping to amplify communities voices and concerns. Another positive development is that the organizers of this Mocha are now engaging themselves in discussing livelihood issues. The potential of this platform is extremely promising.One of the most important achievements noted by our grantees has been the change in attitude of government departments towards the forest rights campaign and work in Jhargram. When they started the work and helped Gram Sabhas to submit claims after meticulous preparation, none of the government departments showed any interest, rather they were actively discouraged from filing submissions. After two years of hard work and regular engagement with District officials, they are now publishing a booklet about the FRA, Gram Sabha and forest rights claims, publishing and circulating claim forms. The District Magistrate is now also promising to look into claims submitted and giving Oak Application Form     10instructions to his subordinate officers on the same and most importantly, the Forest Department is acknowledging the process and sending Forest Officers to talk about FRA claims in a gathering organized by the very same community, with whom they share a contentious relationship. This is a major shift and step forward for State recognition and action in relation to community forest rights. Key learnings from our work in West Bengal so far have shown that:- the most important and effective way to engage and mobilize indigenous communities to claim their rights to land is to equip them with greater understanding of the connection between their cultural identity, traditional practices and customary laws, to the protection of and access to land. We have seen through our grantees work that focusing on this intersection  helping people to see that land is not just a resource but part of indigenous cultural identity  is the most powerful and successful way to empower and mobilize communities for action.-equipping communities with a greater understanding of their constitutional rights and legal provisions is critical- supporting efforts to strengthen the forest governance structure through people centric conservation practices through constitutional remedies such as the PESA, FRA etc. allows communities to demonstrate the meaning of conservation and protection of their natural resources- supporting communities to mobilize, form Gram Sabhas and process collective claims takes considerable time, accompaniment and trust-building, but is an essential process in empowering communities and ensuring the realization of their rights- communities need sound legal aid in order to claim their rights and respond to emerging threats, including criminalization by the state. Support from OakThe Fund seeks a new 4-year partnership with Oak and a grant of $575,000 to help bring the resources and actions needed in this critical moment for grassroots level organizing on land and resource rights issues in West Bengal. With Oaks support the Fund would build on the success and learning from previous work and support a cohort of 4 local groups working on their communities management of and rights to natural resources in West Bengal, likely focused in Jhargram, Purulia, Paschin Bardhaman, Bankura, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar Districts. The Fund would continue to support 2 existing grantees and seek to expand support to 2 new grantees. With Oaks support grantees will receive the resources and support to build on their work, progress and learning so far, with a deepened focus on building community awareness of the power in their cultural identity and heritage, its connection to land, and in pursuing their constitutional rights to land ownership and access. Grantees will be able to continue supporting communities to claim land titles, to scale up their outreach and mobilization efforts into new areas, and to advocate for West Bengals Forest governance structure to be strengthened, ensuring communities have the power and voice in the process through building grassroot mobilization of community-based organisations Oak Application Form     11such as Banadhikargram sabha morcha and Uttar Banga Vanjan Shramajeevi Manch.As far as our grantees liaising with the government departments, this will happen to some extent, especially with district administration, forest department, and nodal agencies such as the Department of Backward class welfare who is primarily responsible for the implementation of Forest Rights. However, grantees likely will not lobby or advocate directly with these departments since the Gram Sabha Morcha  an important peoples network/forum- will take the lead in having direct dialogue with government departments on behalf of its communities. Similarly, North Bengal groups will engage with such departments since they are already working on forest rights although it is not directly supported by our funds.Our proposed work would align strongly with the Funds strategic priorities to shift more resources to grassroots environmental activists and solutions in India, to build indigenous communities resilience and power on environmental issues and their rights, to support intersectional approaches to activism, and to help nurture a grassroots climate justice movement that has indigenous communities, women and youth at its heart and helm.",

Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):The Fund identifies and supports efforts to tackle the deep root causes of injustice and inequality in India. Our carefully selected cohort of grantees is typically diverse and includes many emerging, youth-led groups, groups that are led by people with lived experience from the marginalized communities they are representing, and those using an intersectional approach to their work.With Oaks renewed support, the Fund aims to sustain support to 2-3 existing grantees  enabling them to build on and strengthen work previously supported and expand into new areas - as well as identify and support a further 1-2 new grantees. The Funds process of identifying new grantees would draw on our existing mapping of potential partners, our ongoing Oak Application Form     14learning, and our continued priority to support a diversity of groups and voices, and meet Oaks requirement of supporting FCRA approved groups. Under this new grant the Fund would also seek to provide targeted technical assistance and ongoing accompaniment to enable grantees to realize their goals and objectives under this project, and where possible, and if of interest to grantees, to support and facilitate some learning and knowledge exchange, taking the steer from grantees, as mentioned in the following section, and depending on the resources available. The Fund would also work with grantees to support them to strengthen their leadership - promoting second line leadership  as well as the intergenerational leadership of the communities they are working with.

If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):a. Monitoring and evaluation:The Fund has developed a strategic framework for each country that guides the Funds allocation of its resources and provides a means for evaluating its grant-making over time. Each grantee will be required to submit a proposal every year outlining their proposed work and goals for the year ahead and proposed qualitative and quantitative indicators to track developments and progress. The Funds program staff in India will then speak with each grantee to jointly set indicators  aligned to what we have outlined in this proposal - that they will use to determine whether their efforts are moving in the desired direction.The assessment of these indicators is done typically through six monthly narrative reports.  Alongside these grantee reports, the Funds program staff in India will maintain regular communication with grantees  likely every quarter - as an important part of building strong relationships rooted in trust, and to help maintain open discussions on progress and challenges on their work and strategies. Fund staff will also visit grantees regularly to accompany them in their work, to deepen discussions around strategies, and to encourage ongoing reflection and learning.The Fund recognizes that no work happens in isolation; it can have planned and unplanned impact, just as the emerging social, cultural and political context can impact the work in foreseen and unforeseen ways. During its discussions with grantees, the Funds major role is as a thought partner who Oak Application Form     15can help the grantee understand the role and impact of their organization not just in its own silo, but also in the context of the broader eco-system of organizations. The Fund also provides guidance, and where possible additional support and resources, to also support grantees to build their capacity, leadership and ensure their sustainability. In India, the Fund does this with a particular focus on promoting the development of second line leadership within its grantees and ensuring the younger generation of activists are elevated.b. Learning:The Fund is increasingly nurturing a learning culture and sees learning as an ongoing and self-reinforcing process. Through the ongoing monitoring and evaluation efforts mentioned above, the Fund would seek to deepen its learning on the most effective strategies to build communities resilience and power to claim their rights related to access and management of land and natural resources in West Bengal, as well as on the intersection with protecting indigenous cultural identity. We would then use this reflection and learning to apply a sharper focus to our grantees and our own programming strategies going forward.",

It has been active since 1995 to remove different socio-cultural and structural barriers in the lives of the sex workers and other marginalized communities. Since last 27 years, Durbar is continuously fighting for the protection and promotion of the fundamental rights to the sex workers and other marginalized communities. It has an Executive Committee of 9 persons who are elected from the General Body every three years. The Executive Committee is Oak Application Form     5responsible for all decisions on policy, staff matters, fund raising, budgeting etc.DMSC will be receiving these funds on behalf of the Right to Food and Work Campaign West Bengal (RTF&W Campaign WB). The RTF&W Campaign WB is a network of about 75-80 NGOs, peoples organisations and individuals, of which about 22 are fairly active. They have come together to address the issue of food security and rural employment in West Bengal. A Secretariat facilitates communication between partner NGOs to keep them informed about State and National level activities. Presently, the Steering Group, consisting of four partner organisations, Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, Udayani Social Action Forum, SEWA Bharat and Paschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity, which has only one full time staff member and a part time legal consultant. Everyone else works for the Campaign on a voluntary basis.During the coming year, the Secretariat will expand to include some more staff members to undertake various other activities as mentioned later. On a need-based basis, it may also take on other consultants.   The Steering group will also be expanded to include other interested partner organisations.The Campaign has attempted to establish a North Bengal based network in the last few years which is partially functioning. This still needs nurturing in the next few years before it can function effectively. 5b. Summarise the organisations history.

(300 words)A vertical HIV intervention program was launched in 1992 following a base line study conducted by All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health (AAIH&PH), a Central Govt. institute. The objective was to initiate STD and HIV prevention program in Sonagachi, a red light zone in Kolkata, India. The intervention programme started with three principal components: provision of health services including STD treatment; information, education and communication (IEC); and condom programming. It was in the year 1995 out of felt need by the community members followed by several discussions and consultations, a unique body of the fallen women was formed;  Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) came into existence. This is a forum exclusively set up and managed by sex workers and their children with the objective of creating solidarity and collective strength among the sex worker community and other marginalized groups.1. The success of DMSC run HIV intervention program is known as Sonagachi model being the most successful intervention among sex workers globally. This has helped National Govt. to articulate a strategy called Targeted Interventions for the high risk communities like sex workers, Transgender, MSM population. Based on the Lesson Learnt from Sonagachi Project, NACO (National AIDS Control Oak Application Form     6Organization) articulated the concept of Creating Enabling Environment and Community organizing and Ownership building what became the budgeted and integral component of HIV intervention program. The principles of Sonagachi model was taken to build the foundation of .Bill and Melinda Gates supported HIV intervention program in India spending $350 Million. Both these strategies were also accepted by all UN agencies including big donors like the Global fund DFID etc. in their programmatic approach.2. Durbar is a founder member of All India Network of Sex Workers which at present represent 85 community based organizations of sex workers and TG spread across 18 states in India.3.

We are register member of National Trade Union Initiative [NTUI], a national level trade union in India. The forum  of informal sector women in the state of  West Bengal which represent voices of around one hundred thousand women workers belonging to 18 different occupational group is jointly headed by a sex workers representative from Durbar5. Durbar is part of many women networks who are fighting against gender discrimination, violence against women e.g. Maitreyee, Sramajibi Swikriti Mancha in West Bengal.6. Durbars cultural wing has been very successful who are selected to perform in the Opening Ceremony of International AIDS Conference held in Geneva as well as they were invited in the last two ICAAPs held in Bangkok and Dhaka respectively. The cultural team of Durbar also took part in the India Got Talent program and reached to the finals of the said program.7. In the arena of sports, 8 kids from Durbar were selected for various age group national level tournaments. Two of them have represented the country and one was selected to take training in Manchester United, a well-known club from English Premier League. A team from Durbar took part in Dana Cup in Denmark which is the biggest adolescent group football tournament. They became Group Champions in the said tournament. Durbar is also taking part in the ongoing Sub Junior and Junior Level I-league.8. Durbar is able to prevent the negative amendments of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act through a successful protest march to the Parliament of India in 2006. More than 1000 sex workers were participated in that protest march.9. Conceptualizing and establishing the Self-Regulatory Board which has not only been successful from the strategic point of view but has also been endorsed by the Honble Supreme Court constituted Panel to replicate this model of intervention to curb trafficking in all major cities in India.10. Usha Multipurpose Co-operative Society, a sister organization of Durbar is the example of a sex-workers co-operative which make the Oak Application Form     7sex workers economically empowered At present there are more than thirty thousand members of the said co-operative run by the board of sex workers which has annual turnover of 25 crores of Rupees. Usha was selected as one of the best models in the co-operative movement in West Bengal in 2016.11. In the field of education DURBAR fought a bitter battle to enroll children of sex workers in formal school. In early days they were denied admission, with a tenuous effort based on advocacy and negotiation we succeeded admission of children, since last three years on an average one hundred and fifty children per year could complete schooling. We also run a hostel for 6these kids which accommodate eighty childrenThe Right to Food and Work Campaign West Bengal that has been in existence since 2001. In the last seven to eight years with the financial assistance from the OAK foundation it has made the following major contributions to the issue of food security: -It has been able to strengthen its network and spreads its network in 20 districts in the state.In number of cases unpaid wages under the MGNREGA has been paid by the government due to strong intervention of the Campaign. In the year 2017  18 due to intervention of the campaign about 881 persons were paid their due wages and the approximate amount is Rs.17919540/-Several times, teams on behalf of the Campaign conducted studies in the tea gardens in North Bengal. Through the studies and fact findings, the campaign prepared a number of reports and calculated dues of the workers from the management. From time to time these reports were submitted to the both the central and state government as well before the Honble Supreme Court of India. And finally on 4th April, 2018 Honble Supreme Court in a contempt proceeding of a case filed by Paschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity and other unions directed the government of West Bengal to pay Rs. 15 Cr. to the workers as an interim relief.The campaign organized  training programs for the tea garden workers regarding the procedure of filling claim forms also members of the campaign are consistently monitoring the proper implementation of the order passed by Honble Court on 4th April, 2018 and to find out the problems of the workers to fill the forms.The Supreme Court in 2020 constituted a one-member committee headed by retired Supreme Court judge A.M. Sapre to inspect and verify the claims of workers. The hearing by Justice Sapre's Committee was delayed due to Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. However, on 15.09.2021, the Committee passed an order stating that all the workers of these 29 gardens would have to submit their claim forms and which is an ongoing process till date.Fact finding in to the starvation deaths at Bhatpara, North 24 Parganas, Purulia and Lalgarh, Jhargram have been conducted. This has led to relief programs for the victims and sometimes their communities. In the recent case of hunger death in the district of Oak Application Form     8Jhargram the state government is made accountable and a complaint has been filed to NHRC.Right to Food and Work Campaign have successfully supported a seminar of beneficiaries which was a long due plan. In the said seminar around 300 delegates from 17 districts of Bengal and 36 other organisations came together at Rammohon hall. The objective was to involve beneficiaries in the campaign to monitor the implementation of NFSA, MGNREGA and this seminar is a significant step towards this objective.As per state food security scheme in West Bengal RKSY-I & RKSY-II (Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana) are the two ration card types under which wheat and rice is given to poor people through Public Distribution System (PDS) / Fair Price Shop (FPS). The RKSY (I & II) ration cards are issued to the most financially weaker section of the state who are left uncovered under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). Under the state food security scheme, the entitlements as well as the subsidized price differs to get dry rations from Public Distribution system. The RKSY-I beneficiary gets monthly 5KGs of ration (3 KGs of Wheat per month at the FPS price of ?2 per KG and 2KGs of rice per month at the FPS price of ?2 per KG). Whereas, RKSY-II ration card beneficiary gets 2 KGs of ration (1 KG of Wheat per month at the FPS price of ?9 per KG and 1KGs of rice per month at the FPS price of ?13 per KG). The entitlement of ration under RKSY-II was already less and was pricier than RKSY-I,the Campaign had advocated for the increase in allocation of the PDS entitlements and to ensure equal benefits for RKSY-II card holders. As a result of which, the campaign claims that RKSY-II (Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana-II) ration card holders had got 5 kgs of rations per card per month from PDS at no cost for the initial phase lockdown, but in the later lockdown phases, the original entitlement of 2 KGs of ration per card per month was restored for RKSY-II ration card holders at free of cost. And till date the RKSY-II ration card holders are receiving the ration as per their entitlement at free of cost throughout the state.The strength of our partner organisations has grown due to adequate knowledge of the scheme and laws. As such, they can make the government officials function to implement various schemes.During the induced lockdown and post lockdown the campaign has conducted two research studies to understand the hunger status and the findings of which has been shared with the state government for the proper implementation of food security in the state.The campaign has able to capacitated more than 40 individuals as community leaders identified by the partner organisations.Coordination amongst partner organisations has improved and we have learned how to work together.Oak Application Form     95c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):RTF&W Campaign WB is addressing the problem of food security, focusing especially on hunger deaths and malnutrition. It is working especially on the rights to food and work.  Its work is at various levels. For example, at the grass roots level, it works to ensure that people know about existing rights such as the Supreme Court orders on Right to Food, the NFSA and the MGNREGA. It also understands through the experience at the grass roots about lacunae in the implementation of these rights and mobilises and campaigns to deal with these lacunae at the administrative level. In addition, it also defines and lobbies and campaigns for an expansion of these rights at the State and National level. Civil society activists and local leaders are actively participating in the movement to add momentum and influence the policy makers to be pro poor in nature. The emergent leaders and the CBOs are taking up issues at the micro level and challenging the Panchayat, Block and District administration to be accountable and transparent in their execution of these rights.The challenges facing the Campaign are as follows:-The groups, individuals and the community leaders face difficulties related to pressure from local goons. Besides threats from the local leaders, the administration sometimes creates hindrances in effective implementation. Red tapism and too many bottlenecks related to documents and evidential proof takes more time in actual initiation of the actions to be taken.Organisations are at various levels of understanding of issues and in capacities to deal with such issues. A big challenge is that there are large stretches of blocks and districts where our work has had no impact so far and where we do not have any partners.A big challenge is to maintain communication and co-ordination amongst member organisations of the campaign. The North-South divide in the state in terms of distances as well as issues and even language means that the Campaign will have to have parallel activities for different areas.Similarly, another challenge is to convince member organisations to move out of the project mode (where food security issues are taken up only when there are funds for a project) to the movement mode where these issues become part of their work on a long term basis.This in fact would be the main focus of the project i.e. building capacities and understanding to go from viewing right to food as only a three year project to a view that it is an essential part of each partners work in the long term and that work continues even when the project ends. For this, we will focus on trainings to build capacity, but also give partners practical experience in doing studies, in campaigning and in lobbying. A preclude to such activity will be to actually do an assessment of where the partner is in terms of capacities and understanding of issues.Oak Application Form     10An important focus is also the use of instruments like litigation, studies and publications to bring about public focus on the rights to food and decent employment.The network is learning from its past experiences and incorporating the learnings to the future strategies as and whenever required. For instance, the network is focusing on capacity building of the young generation of the target communities and building them asset to the communities. Also, inclusion of partners and community members in conducting studies helps the network to understand the depth of issue and to collect evidences of negligence/loopholes at the implementation of the social schemes. These documentations support the campaign to file strong litigation to the court. The network is going to emphasize on capacity building and inclusion of communities in these processes. The network will also emphasize on modular group formation as per capacity of the grassroot emerging leaders & existing partner organisations and link such groups on the existing groups at village level, at panchayat level, at Block level, at district level and to state level.",

A big challenge is that there are large stretches of blocks and districts where our work has had no impact so far and where we do not have any partners.FCRA amendment is huge concern to come under governments surveillance for the organisations having FCRA for getting involved into assisting deprived mass to avail their rights.Interpersonal rapport building with the community and educating the target group about their rights and provisions/ways to avail their rights can sort out the political negative influence.An important focus is also the use of instruments like litigation, studies and publications to bring about public focus on the rights to food and decent employment.Building up & working of second layer of leadership at community level can reduce the concern of FCRA holding organisations.",

EdelGive is currently part of 6 big collaboratives in diverse domains; in critical capacities.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):India is home to 1.4 billion people from diverse communities with each community having its own distinct challenges.  Despite Government intervention and policies over the years, there have been gaps in addressing community needs, leaving some unaddressed and unheard.Grassroot organisations role hence is fundamental to addressing social needs from a microscopic lens. Although, India receives the highest foreign aid from across the world, philanthropic efforts are unreachable/inequitably distributed towards the rural marginalized sections or urban poverty pockets within cities.Hence, AFEFs mission was born out of this realization to support small and mid-sized organisations in India who understand the dynamic development dilemmas of the communities, their immediate needs and provide sustainable solutions. AFEF aims to fulfil this by focusing on:Education  With a belief that every child has the right to attend school and learn in school, AFEF seek to address the systemic gaps that impact childrens access to quality education.Women Empowerment  Adopt a rights-based approach to support women in society, free them from violence and discrimination, build awareness and accessibility to their rights and entitlements, make them economically independent and build grassroots leaders.Livelihoods  Work with vulnerable communities affected by unemployment, failing agriculture and natural calamities through interventions targeted towards building the resilience of the rural and tribal populations.AFEF will scope/invite proposals from organisations implementing critical initiatives in India, and through a thorough due diligence process will award grantees with AFEFs multi-year grants approach. AFEF has also partnered with EdelGive, to assist with the scoping process, monitoring and fund management in India.AFEF with EdelGive joined its first collaborative, to support the GROW Fund as an anchor funder to help sustain 100 organisations for 2 years whose operations have been impacted owing to the pandemic.6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):Grant Application Form, July 1 20137ContextThe rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in devastating consequences for economies, businesses, and communities across the globe. In India particularly, lockdowns have more deeply affected migrant and vulnerable communities who are grappling with loss of income, livelihood, food, healthcare and resultant uncertainty and helplessness.Grassroot organisations have been at the forefront of addressing these problems but have also become casualties themselves owing to extreme financial distress that is likely to leave a lasting, negative impact outliving their capacities to mitigate them. Studies done during the COVID-19 period have reported that NGOs are facing lack of access to basic technology, salary cuts, lay-offs, inability to pay rent or source basic supplies for daily sustenance are already prevailing issues.Of the 388 NGOs that responded to a Bridgespan survey on Building Strong, Resilient NGOs in India: Time for New Funding Practices:54% had less than 3 months of reserves in Sep20, 50% NGOs never had an operating surplus61% NGOs based in non-metro areas are worse off than in metros others with less than 3 months of reserves60% NGOs led by leaders from historically disadvantaged communities (DBA-Dalit, Bahujan Adivasi communities) have lower financial resilience with less than 3 months of reserves, against 53% of non-DBA led NGOs.The Impact of Covid-19 on India's Nonprofit Organisations report by CSIP based on survey responses from close to 300 NGOs and 52 interviews reported the following insights on challenges being faced:Operating in accordance with social distancing norms (61%)Dealing with financial insecurity (55%)Managing staff including remote work and ensuring staff well-being and safety (70%).Burnout and exhaustion given that many NPOs worked at capacity and beyond with limited staff strengthSuspension of programs owing to discontinued funding and limited or absent resource mobilisation capacity.Given the above realities and facts, the possibility of breakdown of this cadre of organisations whom Foundations like AFEF rely on to deliver last-mile relief to communities, is worrisome.Opportunities:As funders and grantmakers, AFEF and EdelGive deem it our responsibility to ensure the grassroots sector sustains through:Recognition of grassroots work and of the risks that will be encountered if it were to ceaseAcknowledgment of challenges that threaten to derail this workReadiness to arrive at urgent, practical and longer term solutions to address these challengesAs proponents of collaborative rather than siloed approaches having experience of anchoring multiple Coalitions, we were among the first partners to join Bridgespans Pay What it Takes initiative which is committed to building stronger, Grant Application Form, July 1 20138more financially resilient NGOs. We have conceived the GROW Fund as part of our mission to strengthen small and medium NGOs to emerge stronger and stay sturdy to overcome crises like COVID-19.The GROW Fund brings together like-minded Indian and international funders in a collaborative model (in line with PWIT tenets) to collectively address the challenges facing grassroots NGO in India. The Fund will demonstrate a new future of funding model that will ensure two-year support 100 vetted organisations, cover their core cost, provide capacity building (CB) support and organisational development support for future readiness (FR).The GROW Fund has currently received commitments covering ~50% of its total budget and is in the process of initiating the call for proposals by August end.The success of the GROW Fund 2021-2024 is anticipated to pave way for similar initiatives/subsequent rounds of GROW to shape the narrative of philanthropy in and for India.Challenges:We anticipate certain natural occurrences, which may hamper the projects timelines/focus such as recurring relapse of COVID-19 that may lead to nationwide lockdowns and threat to lives.The challenges to organizational resilience are multi-fold and we will adopt a multi-dimensional approach to address them through common as well as customized alternatives for grantees",

With increased competition for limited grant resources in sexual and reproductive health, the focus would be on tapping into multiple funding streams to attract, create and sustain new resources, with an emphasis on innovative approaches, corporate involvement and non-conventional methods.Expected significant changes to the financial situation :Core grant reduced by 10% in year 2021 over the Year 2020.GCACI project grant reduced by 38% of the sanctioned budget in Year 2021GCACI project will be close in Dec 2021.The operational costs for 2021 have been worked out as per the reduced project grant.Impact of the changes in managing core costsWith reduction in the core grants, it is likely that HR costs, especially new recruitments under Core positions may be affected. As far as possible, these reductions are absorbed by the Hqs, under programme costs and HR costs are protected.6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Family Planning Association of India was established in 1949 to successfully advocate for the inclusion of family planning in the First Five Year Plan of the newly independent India.  The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) was founded in 1952 in Mumbai with FPA India as its Founder Member.FPA India has grown since, with each decade marked by pioneering work to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights of all, including men, women, young people, key populations, underserved, marginalized poor and vulnerable groups.Grant Application Form, July 1 20137FPA India was represented in the Shantilal Shah Committee which was instrumental in providing a framework for the legalization of abortions in India in 1964 that led to the formation of the MTP Act 1971. Recently, the MTP Act has been amended and FPA India has been invited by the MoHFW to be a part of the committee to formulate the rules and regulations needed to implement the amended clauses.Other major projects and successesoFounder member of a large national coalition of civil society organizations, Advocating Reproductive Choices (ARC) and held the secretariat of ARC for more than 6 years (2008-2014).oMember of the Technical Advisory Group of the Pratigya Campaign on Safe Abortion in India.oServed as Regional Resource Centre, entrusted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to support the implementation of the RCH programme through Mother/Field and Service NGOs to mother NGOs, field NGOs and Service NGOs in a few states of India ,oFPA India runs 19 Urban Family Welfare Centres to provide family planning and maternal and child health services funded by the State Government in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):FPA India is currently implementing a 7 year Strategic Plan (2016-2022) focused on Strengthening Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Services, Advocacy, Gender, Empowerment, and Young People, and Organizational Efficiency. The Strategic Plan envisions all people empowered to enjoy their sexual and reproductive health choices and rights in an India free from stigma and discrimination.Mission - A voluntary commitment to SRHR to advocate for and enable gender equality for all including the poor and vulnerable people, ensure information education and services powered by knowledge, innovation, and technology towards sustainable development.FPA India has deployed different models of programming to expand and deepen the service delivery network, deliver and enable comprehensive sexuality education to adolescents, implement inclusive and targeted interventions for the SRHR of key populations, address gender disparities and gender-based violence.Some of the recommended actions proposed during the mid-term review of the strategic plan conducted in 2019, that have a bearing on the expansion plans proposed  under this project:1. Enable representation of FPA India in committees formulating block level and district level action plans to contribute to the State PIPs, through as many Branches of FPA India as possible for creating a synergy between Youth, women empowerment, and health service delivery programme of FPA India and the corresponding programmes and schemes implemented by the government bodies in those blocks and districts (Such as the RKSK, the RMNCH+A, MHM, AEP) Grant Application Form, July 1 201382. Form consortia for identifying specific priorities (Such as Access/Agency/Entitlements), building consensus, and driving collective action3. Focus on economic empowerment of women through entrepreneurial skill-building4. Enable services through partner clinics Private and NGO facilities as well as government health facilities to expand outreachDrivers of the Strategic Plan relevant to this project-The unmet need for family planning and SRH services continues to be high. According to NFHS 4, the percentage of the Unmet Need for Family Planning (currently married women age 1549 years) is found to be 12.9%. Of 37% of contraceptive demand among adolescents (15-19 years) in India, only 15% have been met leading to 22% of unmet need (NFHS 4). The unmet need for spacing methods is much higher (26%) among adolescents in India compared to the unmet need for limiting (2.5%).[1]Inequalities-gender & poverty continue to impact health and empowerment outcomes; Stigma and discrimination of age, marital status, class, gender, caste, sexuality other markers pose major challenges to the implementation of SRHR.Availability of government schemes: a large number of schemes are currently being implemented by the government for young people, women, and vulnerable groups related to health, livelihood and rights. These pose as opportunities for a strong referral system and partnership building that can enable FPA India and its various associates including clients to avail the schemes thereby affecting long-term SRHR outcomes.Wide and varied provider base: There are a large number of registered, formal, and non-formal health care providers across the country. Opportunities exist in partnerships in integrating SRHR and in task shifting will ensure a wider pool of providers at all levels.  6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):The project attempts to address sexual and reproductive health and rights issues faced by individuals and communities due to gender, age, caste, and socioeconomic differentials.Our ongoing work in the operational areas of Kalchini and Kolkata has demonstrated an increasing demand for comprehensive abortion care, family planning, cervical cancer screening and management, maternal and child health services, gender-based violence screening and continuum of care for survivors, comprehensive sexuality education for adolescents and for some FGDs with key stakeholders conducted in 2017, regarding their perspectives on family planning. Additionally, there is a report of an intervention in the Buxaduar area of Kalchini that underscores the high need for SRH services for the high-need satellite clinic intervention in Kalchini and Kolkata that needs to be sustained.As per NFHS-4 data for India, the percentage of married women aged 15-49 years Grant Application Form, July 1 20139who use any modern contraceptive method stands at 47.8%. Of these, women in the age group of 20-24 who were married before the age of 18 stand at 26.8%. Also, women in the age group of 15-19 who were already mothers/pregnant before 18 years is significantly high in the state of West Bengal (16.4%).Data also shows that adolescents and youth have limited awareness about sexual and reproductive health matters. For instance, only 15% of young men and women (1524 years) reported receiving any family life or sex education.Home to nearly 18% of the worlds population, India also has the largest number of people living below the international poverty line of USD 1.90 a day. The socio-economic disparities in India increased further during the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 140,000,000 (14 crores) Indians lost employment during the lockdown. More than 45% of households across the nation reported an income drop as compared to the previous year.Situated near Indo-Bhutan International Border, most people from the operational area of Kalchini are dependent on Tea Gardens. These tea garden workers are deprived of their daily wages as per the government protocol. The health-seeking behaviour among the Tea Garden workers is also found to be very low due to the lack of easily accessible health facilities in the villages of remote and forest areas. The tea estates are located deep in the interiors with no Government or private health facilities available nearby. There is a lack of good means of transport and the roads leading up to the tea estates/gardens are in a bad condition. This makes it even more difficult for healthcare professionals to get there to render health services to the workers and families. An assessment of the needs of the tea garden community during an intervention led by FPA India in Darjeeling district showed a high need for SRH and general health services. The findings suggested a need for an integrated SRHR intervention for the health and well-being of tea garden workers and high demand from the community for continuation of the intervention, as they experience improved access to health care and an improvement in their health-seeking behaviour.The second wave of covid-19 has further exposed the potholes in the healthcare systems. Given the restrictions on movement during the lockdown, peoples ability to access health care services was severely impacted. Sexual and Reproductive healthcare services, including maternal and child healthcare, safe abortion services & Gender-based violence services were among the most severely impacted, with the lack of access to ante-natal care & GBV care leading to a rise in preventable deaths. A surge in gender-based violence cases particularly domestic violence showed the gendered nature of the pandemic and the need for sustained intervention. The COVID - 19 pandemic has given an opportunity to FPA India to expand the service coverage in Kalchni and Kolkata by engaging government and private players to utilize and explore the digital health solutions into practice & build infrastructure capacities to facilitate telemedicine & teleconsultation models to address the SRH needs of communities, without fragmenting the existing landscapes of service delivery of care. FPA India Kalchini Branch covers a population of more than 10 lakhs across Kalchini and Madarihaat blocks and Madarihaat municipality. Besides serving a large population of tea garden workers and their families, the branch reaches out to the most vulnerable and marginalized groups that include female sex workers at Grant Application Form, July 1 201310Jaigaon (Indo Bhutan Border) and Alipurduar, Persons Living with HIV AIDs (PLWHA) in Alipurduar. The Branch is also associated with 380 CBOs, SHGs and youth groups that can be mobilized for community-based interventions. In recent months, the Branch has also started conducting Rapid Antigen tests for COVID-19 for all clients with symptoms/history of exposure who visit the clinic for non-COVID essential SRH services. The local district authorities rely on the FPAI team in Kalchini to deliver last-mile contraceptive supplies and immunization services to needy populations in hilly terrains where there are no motorable roads or government health facilities. FPA India Kolkata Branch covers (Urban, peri-urban, rural and slum-based populations of more than 18 lakh, in Howrah, Hooghly, and North & South 24 Paraganas. The Branch has initiated interventions in the high need areas of Canning, Kultoli, Shason, Bhangor, Shamnagar, Icchapur, Champdani, Shreerampur, Watgunge, Tollygunge, Raidighi, Songachi, Sheoraphuli, reaching out to the most vulnerable communities including female Sex workers, transgenders, men having sex with men (MSMs), Injecting Drug Users, migrants and the elderly. A network of 47 Self Help Groups, 60 Youth Groups and 6 CBOs work closely with the Branch, to enable community-based interventions. Thus FPAI has been continually responsive to the community needs as well as the requests from health authorities to bridge the gaps in the SRH services, leading to an organic evolution of the programme from a family planning intervention in the early years to a more comprehensive SRH programme.With support from Oak, FPA India will be able to conduct capacity building and advocacy interventions to energize the public health system and build community networks of vulnerable groups for sustained demand generation. Thus, the intervention will bring about a transformational change in the community, from being beneficiaries of the programmes to stakeholders in the process of development. FPAI will also invest in partnerships such as with Ipas, to make inroads into newer geographies, for example, in the SundarbansFPAI will expand focused SRH work in the high need Sundarbans areas through the FPAI Kolkata branch, specifically in Kultali, Hingalganj, Canning, Gadkhali, Basanti and Gosaba in south 24 parganas. This will be a new operational area.",

Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):To advocate for health system strengthening for improving access to rights-based SRH services including comprehensive abortion care in Kalchini and Kolkata districts. FPA India has been providing SRH information and services in the aforementioned operational areas of Kalchini and Kolkata. Based on the steady increase in footfalls to the clinics of FPA India, or the number of beneficiaries reached through community-based interventions, there is a sustained need for SRH interventions. The public health infrastructure within the operational areas is also reliant upon the FPAI teams for last-mile service delivery (Kalchini), or to conduct male sterilization procedures (Kolkata). Ever since the onset of the pandemic, FPAI has received requests to increase the range of services provided (especially in Kalchini) and expand services to newer geographies (particularly in Kolkata).

Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Programme activities:1. Building capacities of community-based volunteers towards primary and secondary prevention of gender-based violence, early marriages, and reducing abortion stigma by creating community-based support groups and pressure groups, particularly in the tribal areas and tea gardens of Kalchini in the Duars and in the red light district of Sonagachi in Kolkata. The community-based volunteers will be trained to alert the police, provide a safe place for the survivors within the community, and refer the survivors to medical care and counseling. (Timeframe - Yr1, yr2)This activity attempts to build skills of community-based volunteers in identifying vulnerable persons and survivors of GBV and delivering a rapid response to mitigate risksCommunity-based volunteers will be selected from amongst ASHAs and members of local voluntary groups active in the operational area.  A Bell Bajao campaign will be launched in mid-year for primary and secondary prevention of GBV through trained community-based volunteers. Through this campaign, community-based volunteers will be trained to intervene safely, to diffuse a potential scene of GBV in their neighbourhood. They will also be trained to assess risks and seek help from the local authorities to prevent escalation of the situation. Members of PRIs will be important stakeholdersTraining will be conducted by the project team, supported by subject matter experts (external), Regular review meetings, and refresher training. Typically, through this project, one community-based volunteer will be selected and trained to reach out to a population of about 2000, similar to the population allotted to one ASHA.2. To empower GBV survivors, particularly women tea garden workers, female sex workers, young women and key population groups belonging to ethnic and socially vulnerable communities.

        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. ImpactGrant Application Form, July 1 201318What is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum 300 words):FPA India proposes to work in coordination with all partners to consolidate interventions in existing geographies and to invest in a need-based expansion to additional geographies in North and South Bengal over a period of four years.The long-term outcome of this expansion plan is to contribute to a shift in the key indicators of health and empowerment for a larger cohort of vulnerable populations.The proposed interventions are expected to energize the existing health system. Sub-optimally functional tea garden hospitals in the expanded intervention area (Kumargram block in Alipuduar District) identified during the baseline will be revived through a public-private partnership to deliver quality assured family planning and SRH services. Increased allocation and utilization of available resources from the district PIPs for family planning will expand the trained provider base and equipped facilities for delivering FP and SRH services in intervention blocks.At the end of 4 years, the total population covered will increase by 50% from the baseline.Short-term outcomes, measurable across the project span will be the number of persons by type of vulnerability availing critical SRH services such as comprehensive abortion care, institution-based safe deliveries, cervical cancer detection and treatment, and continuum of care for surviving gender-based violence.Socio-behavioral change in the community will be measured by assessing the change in the proportion of men and boys accessing SRH services, including family planning and the proportion of youth groups actively involved in peer training and support to keep their neighborhoods safe from GBV.Process documentation to capture successes and challenges in the course of implementation will guide replication of the project interventions in other geographies and serve as a tool for advocacy and resource mobilization for evidence-based programming.10. EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):Monthly service statistics on the defined set of indicators are being collected from all service delivery points online DHIS2 (District Health Information System). Apart from this, programme activities-related information will be periodically collected through descriptive reports, case studies, and other documents. Through a monthly/quarterly tacking system, service statistics, and other processes, indicators are monitored at the grassroots level up to the HQ level. Client Exit Grant Application Form, July 1 201319interviews are conducted routinely with the purpose of improving the quality of services provided in a manner that is more acceptable to community members and clients. Regular monitoring visits, observations, clinic audits,s and self-assessment of QoC checklist will be carried out. This enables monitoring progress and makes evidence-based decisions for programme implementation. The performance of the project will be monitored systematically at all levels to review progress being made and to make necessary key decisions at the right time. At the branch level, the program is overseen by the Branch in In-charge. At the HQ level, programme team reviews the performance, and feedback is given to the Branch. Programmatic decisions will be taken both at the Branch/Project and HQ levels during monthly/quarterly review meetings. The best practices/lessons learned from the project will be disseminated through social media, meetings with stakeholders, workshops, seminars, national/international conferences, and other such forums as well as through the Associations publications.The baseline study will be conducted to capture current estimates of defined indicators upon which the project will strategically improve over the project cycle. Further, to track the performance This will enable us to improve the programme design based on the learnings. We envisage the important evidence generated through the intervention will be captured through an End-line evaluation study. This will feed into the documentation of learnings and successful strategies for extension, expansion, and replication.

(300 words)The foundation of Environment Conservation Society (ECS) was laid in 2008 with a 1500 km long cycle ride across the coal belt of India to take the words Oak Application Form     6of climate change to the youth. The initial years of ECS were invested in spreading climate consciousness across educational institutions. Between 2010 and 2017, ECS spun off 3 social enterprises respectively to take decentralized energy solutions to the underserved, to address unsustainable agriculture through an alternative ecosystem around organic agriculture, and to incubate Green Entrepreneurs.ECSs current outreach is to over 5560 villages and urban agglomerations across nine states in India, ranging from Maharashtra in the west to Manipur in the east. One of the major projects in early days was on Capacity Building for Sustainable Access to Clean Energy in Eastern India. Since then, ECS has implemented 57 projects, with average duration of 18.75 months and average value of 7.8 million INR. This includes promotion of 60 FPOs within last few years. 50% of these FPOs are 15-26 months old, having average cumulative turnover of INR 19,64,786 and average annual turnover of INR 9,81,630 per FPO.Impact assessment of our program on Solar pump in Jharkhand revealed that 79% of Solar Pump beneficiaries enhanced their agricultural productions whereas 65% stopped using diesel pumps. In Chattisgarh, 65% beneficiaries enhanced their income through efficient irrigation systems.ECS received Pacesetter Award in 2016 by MNRE to encourage investment in off-grid clean energy development, and ICC Social Impact Award in 2020 in the area of Clean Energy. ECS is empanelled with MNRE for programs around energy access in rural India, empanelled and functioning as a training provider with PMKVY, Utkarsh Bangla-PBSSD, NISE etc. For affiliation of standard operating procedures, were associated with SCGJ (Skill Council for Green Jobs). 5c.

If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):The key issues faced by the small tea growers of northern West Bengal include agro-technical problems (pest and insect attacks), lack of technical knowledge (early identification of plant diseases/pest attacks and their control measures), lack of irrigation facilities and associated dependency on fossil fuel to operate agri-machineries, lack of credit facilities. These reasons are leading to a higher cost of producing tea @INR 20 per Kg whereas the market is paying a price of INR 15-18 per kg, making it unsustainable. On the other hand, major challenges faced by tea garden workers in the region include low wages, poor working conditions, lack of land rights and housing, limited access to education and healthcare, seasonal unemployment, and exploitation and inequality. The proposed project aims to address these challenges and improve well-being of communities in 3 tea gardens and 2500 small tea growers across in Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Darjeeling districts in the following ways:Oak Application Form     7Limited access to clean cooking solutions: The project aims to promote the adoption of sustainable and clean energy sources and appliances to reduce the community's reliance on firewood. This will help conserve forests, protect wildlife habitats, mitigate climate change effects, and improve community's health. Inadequate lighting and electricity access: The project at one hand will focus on providing lighting in public spaces to enhance the security of women and children, and on the other hand will extend study hours, enable the utilization of smart devices, and enhance educational development for children in the community by ensuring energy access at household level. Lack of energy for clean water access: The project will implement renewable energy based solutions for clean water access towards reducing the prevalence of waterborne diseases, and improving overall health and well-being, and ensuring irrigation. Limited access to energy for livelihood activities: While in one hand the project willensure exposure, resource linkage and access to renewable energy based solutions to address agro-technical problems faced by the small tea growers, on the other hand it will promote diverse livelihood options beyond the tea industry focusing on the tea garden workers.Our approach to solve the aforementioned problems would involve a four-pronged strategy: conducting research for needs assessment, identification and sourcing of appropriate technologies, skill and capacity building around technology and process, and establishing an ecosystem that connects stakeholders across the value chain. We aim to empower these communities by promoting their self-reliance through access to financial resources, markets, and government schemes. Technology and innovation will drive sustainability, and a comprehensive research framework will inform evidence-based decision-making and policy.Oak's funding will be utilized through a comprehensive approach, including needs assessments in terms of energy requirement, market study/scoping study to identify appropriate technology solutions, study on potential of green jobs within and outside intervention area, capacity and skill development of community around tailored livelihood avenues and associated energy technologies, handholding support for community engagement across value chains through livelihood support centre, establishing resource linkages for renewable energy  driven infrastructure development, promoting community institution through technology and buyer expo for scale and market linkage, monitoring and evaluation, informing policy, and ensuring sustainability and replicability. It will also contribute to establishing partnerships, documenting best practices, and enable the replication of successful models.Identification of the problems and determination of our approach was based on consultation, research, and experience-based learning. We conducted situational analysis with tea-garden communities in Kalimpong (West Bengal), consulted institutions like local FPOs, Tea Board and The Oak Application Form     8Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers Associations (Cista). Their insights and ground observations informed our understanding of the challenges faced by communities around tea industry as well as probable solutions.",

If none were received, please leave this section blank. Part A:1. Please summarise a few projects which are similar in nature. Provide details on project objectives, interventions, community reach, geography and the impact (specific metrics related to adoption of renewable energy, improvement in yield, returns, household level income).Project Name: Powering Agriculture-Community Based Solar Pump (Indo-U.S Pacesetter Fund)Geography: West Bengal, Jharkhand, and OdishaDuration: 2016-19Project Objectives:Unlocking financing for marginal farmers to install solar pumpsTest innovative business model interventions for solar pumps by setting up Guarantee FundRemoving barriers for clean energy adoption among low-income farming communities.Community Reach:Low income farming communitiesWomen Self-help group membersImpact:Farmers have witnessed a 1.6x rise in income through better productivity, water selling and crop diversification.On an average, each farmer has been able to save $50-$100 per month on irrigation.Decrease in at least 60 tonnes of CO2 emissions with every solar pump over the lifetime of the pump by replacing diesel pumps.Forex saving of USD 300 per annum per replaced diesel pump Project Name: Empowering Lives in East India (Good Energies)Geography: Purba Bardhaman district of West BengalDuration: 2018-20Project Objectives:Oak Application Form     15Integration of appropriate sustainable energy solutions in life and livelihood.To improve the productivity & profitability of farmersTo improve the environment and mitigate the harmful effects of climate changeCommunity Reach:Marginalized rural communitiesWomen-headed households and Women Self-Help Group membersFarmer Groups of communityImpact:Farmers of water group have witnessed a 1.66x rise in income through better productivity.An average farmer has been able to annex at least one additional crop in her/his agriculture profile.An average woman involved in agriculture has been able to save at least 3 extra hours per day.2.What has been the learning from prior projects of similar nature?Some key learnings include:1. The lack of an ecosystem for promotion of Distributed renewable energy solutions and the significance of awareness & capacity building of key stakeholders to address resource depletion and environmental challenges.2. The importance of engaging grassroots civil society organizations which leads to amplification of the impact and reach of initiatives.3. Adoption of the nexus approach between energy, water, and agriculture yields multidimensional benefits for both the environment and rural communities.4. Women as key stakeholders in natural resource management empowers them and leads to robust and sustainable outcomes.5. Building strategic partnerships with state nodal agencies, banks, and financial institutions leads to efficient project implementation and facilitates better access to financing & resources.6. Capacity building through training programs and knowledge dissemination strengthens the skills and expertise of stakeholders, particularly youth and rural women.7. Leveraging digital platforms, such as Learning Management Systems, creates active knowledge banks and expands the reach of educational resources to the communities at large..8. Promoting collective action and formalizing networks fosters collaboration and resource sharing among organizations working towards similar goals.Oak Application Form     169. Implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices and fostering innovations improves adaptation and resilience of disadvantaged communities in the face of climate change.Drawing from these learnings, ecosystem approach has been a by-default aspect of any project involving rural communities. Also, in our recent program regarding monitoring of groundwater and its recharge through watershed planning, rural women have been central players right from periodic groundwater monitoring. These successful approaches will guide the current project in achieving its objectives and maximizing its impact on just energy transition and sustainable resource management.3.If cap-ex for technology products is to be sourced from schemes, why is the budget component so high? There has to be a clear rationale on the budget.This is primarily due to the lack of an existing ecosystem that should encompass interlinkages between Technology, Scheme, Finance, Production Chain, and Market, which would be crucial for ensuring effective energy access and livelihood enhancement for the small tea growers and tea garden workers..To establish this essential ecosystem, it is necessary to engage a group of professionals who possess the expertise and experience in bridging the gaps between various stakeholders. These professionals will play a vital role in identifying suitable technology solutions, coordinating with relevant schemes for capital expenditure, establishing financial mechanisms, facilitating production chain integration, and creating market linkages. Cost covered for training and capacity building is a little less than half of the proposed grant. Also, extensive research during the first 6 months of the project and demonstration of DRE applications during the first two years of the project will require significant program expenditure.We believe that investing in the establishment of this ecosystem is essential to overcome the existing barriers and challenges faced by the these communities. By doing so, we can create a solid foundation for future projects, streamline the implementation of renewable technologies, and effectively leverage available schemes for capital expenditure on technology products.The estimated budget for the proposed project is USD 160 per beneficiary family. Out of this USD 107 per family is being sought from OAK Foundation. Out of this, an estimated cost for the whole package of training would be USD 42 per family during the tenure of the project. The cost for all 6 researches would be USD 6 per family. Developing ecosystem (Stakeholder meeting, buyer-seller meet, producer expo) would cost USD 11 per family. Maintaining MIS throughout the project period would cost USD 4 per family. A team of 9 full-time staffs (Capacity Building Manager, Communication Manager, Livelihood Expert, Energy Expert and 5 Tea-Garden Coordinators) would be involved right from inception till the completion of the project for handholding support to community throughout the journey. Individuals in this team will be paid a monthly average salary of USD 455 (Range of USD 377-566). Total cost to this team would be  USD 39 per family throughout the project period.4.What are the possibilities of enhancing the committed co-financing from the present USD 50,000?Oak Application Form     17Currently, we have secured a core grant of USD 50,000 from MacArthur Foundation. These commitments have been instrumental in enabling us to initiate the project and lay the foundation for its success.After careful consideration and exploring potential avenues, we have identified the possibility of enhancing the committed co-financing up to a maximum of USD 84,000.5.The solar cookstoves model has not been so successful till date. What are the strategies to be adopted towards mitigating this risk. What learnings can you factor in from other models implemented elsewhere. Please undertake a secondary research on the same.In Guatemala, the Solar Household Energy project effectively increased the adoption of solar cookstoves by providing tailored training, addressing cultural preferences, and ensuring affordability (Source: https://www.she-inc.org/). Similarly, in India, the Solar Cooking Project successfully promoted solar cookstoves by involving local communities in the design and promotion process, emphasizing health and environmental benefits, and facilitating access to finance (Source: https://www.solarcookers.org/work). For instance, Barli Institute has been successfully experimenting with solar cookers for over 22 years in Madhya Pradesh.  Since 1998 the Institute has developed its kitchen tailored to solar cooking, and has installed 3 large Scheffler parabolic cookers in this kitchen. It has an ongoing program on solar cooking and food processing where the institute prepares all its meals for 130 persons per day with solar cookers (for about 300 solar days a year), saving up to 12 cylinders of cooking gas (equivalent to about 900 kilograms of wood) each month. This program helps women to escape the daily, back-breaking work of fuel gathering, and preserve forest and woodlands and reduce air pollution. The institute provides training in maintenance of SK-14 & Prince-15 parabolic domestic solar cookers. The ex-trainees also introduce and demonstrate the benefits of solar cooking to their neighboring communities.(https://www.barli.org/english-brochure.html)Applied Science and Engineering was founded by Dr. Srinivasa Ravuri from Secunderabad in Telangana. Srinivasa created this organization to pursue research, design, and promotion of solar-thermal implements that can be used for cooking, heating, food drying, and for water desalination. The organization has been involved with solar cooking since 2008. By 2016 they had distributed 50 solar cookers and had taught over 200 people to solar cook with solar box cookers, parabolic cookers, and solar food dryers.(https://solarcooking.fandom.com/wiki/Applied_Science_and_Engineering)We dont have a mandated agenda to promote Solar Cooker in the intervention area. The approach would be to first test the technical feasibility of Solar Cooker in the region. Upon successful trial, we can set up pilot projects and demonstration centers in collaboration with local partners and organizations. This can include community meetings, demonstrations, and interactive sessions to address any misconceptions or skepticism. These initiatives can showcase the effectiveness of solar cookers, allowing community members to see the benefits firsthand and gain confidence in the technology. Our recent fact finding visit in Kalimpong shows that more and more households in the tea-garden communities are getting LPG gas connection and reducing dependence on firewood. However, considering the costs involved in LPG gas Oak Application Form     18connection, sharing the burden with Solar cook-stove in a hybrid mode would surely prove to be a cost-cutting model.6.There should be a clear market study/scoping study on available technological equipment (supply chain, maintenance, costs) and a study of the green jobs and entrepreneurship potential in the region. This should inform the training interventions for the youth and identify the sectors, businesses (locally and regionally) for placement of these youth. What are the types of entrepreneurship avenues possible related to renewables in the region?The market and scoping study will comprehensively analyze the existing technological equipment relevant to renewable energy solutions, including their supply chain, maintenance requirements, and costs. Additionally, the study will assess the green jobs and entrepreneurship potential in the region, identifying sectors and businesses suitable for youth placement. It will also explore various entrepreneurship avenues related to renewables. The study will gather data through surveys, interviews, and field visits, assessing market demand, local needs, and potential for sustainable businesses. Findings will inform targeted training interventions for youth and guide the development of a robust ecosystem for renewable energy adoption and entrepreneurship in the region. A few important aspects to be covered are as follows -Technology Assessment: The study will assess the availability, suitability, and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy technologies in the market. This includes solar cook stoves, solar pumps, and other DRE appliances.Green Jobs and Entrepreneurship Potential: It will identify potential sectors with growth opportunities for green jobs and entrepreneurship, considering the region's ecological and socio-economic context.Training Needs Analysis: The study will analyze the skill gaps and training requirements for youth to actively engage in the renewable energy sector and green job opportunities.Local and Regional Business Identification: It will identify and assess local and regional businesses that align with renewable energy solutions and green practices, offering placement opportunities for trained youth.Policy and Regulatory Analysis: The study will analyze existing policies and regulations related to renewable energy and identify opportunities and challenges for entrepreneurship.The study's outcomes will be instrumental in guiding the project's interventions and ensuring that youth are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in the growing renewable energy market while fostering entrepreneurship and sustainable practices in the region.7.SwitchON should consider narrowing down of the programme just focusing on meeting the energy needs (electricity, water, cooking fuel, lighting). The strategy for broadening the set of interventions should be well thought of and selective (youth training and employment, entrepreneurship, alternative livelihoods).While we understand the importance of selectivity and a well-thought-out strategy, we also recognize the need for a comprehensive approach to address the multifaceted challenges faced by the small tea growers and tea garden workers. By providing a basket of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) Oak Application Form     19solutions, there is opportunity to address the immediate energy needs of the target community while also promoting alternative livelihood opportunities. Based on the terrain of tea-garden and availability of land, a few environmentally compatible value chain options could be Eco-tourism and Hospitality (homestays, cultural experiences), Small scale organic farming (Spices, Herbs etc.), Beekeeping and Honey Production, Dairy and Livestock Farming, Making of Sal-Leaf plates, Mushroom Cultivation, Horticulture (fruit-bearing trees, mushroom, medicinal plants, herbal plants). However, choosing the combination of suitable livelihood would depend on a number of factors including availability of spare land, access to forest, marketability etc. We acknowledge the importance of thoughtful selection and prioritization of interventions based on local context, market demand, and community needs. Our team will conduct thorough assessments and engage in dialogue with the communities in 3 tea gardens and small tea growers across in Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Darjeeling districts to identify the most relevant and impactful interventions. While the central focus would be to help 2500 small tea growers and tea garden workers (3 tea gardens) meet the energy needs, the resources will also be invested in making the community aware of the scopes and possibilities around alternate sustainable livelihood option in an ecosystem approach to enhance their resilience to future challenges. Also among targeted 5000 families (including both tea garden workers and small tea growers), there would always be a few risk-takers who would come forward to learn and adapt new livelihood avenues in small scale with assured market. Their success will be the living demonstrations to boost the courage of a few others to come forward.A recent feasibility study conducted in northeast India's tea estates, a major tea-growing region, found a significant opportunity for adopting renewable energy systems. The study surveyed eight tea gardens (four from Assam and four from West Bengal) and seven tea processing industries. It revealed that tea gardens believe that installing large solar panels would not affect tea plant growth. Solar energy was preferred over other alternatives due to lower costs and easier installation. Most tea gardens (87.5%) have unused or barren land suitable for solar panel installation, while a few (12.5%) do not.(https://krishi.icar.gov.in/jspui/bitstream/123456789/71187/1/FeasibilitystudyonrenewableenergysysteminteaCamelliasinensis.pdf)(https://india.mongabay.com/2022/02/assam-tea-gardens-experiment-with-solar-for-reliable-power-supply-and-cutting-costs-emissions/)8.What about the geography? Kalimpong exclusively or layering on other tea gardens across the tea garden region.Environment Conservation Society has no pressing agenda of sticking to Kalimpong as project area. Strategically, it would rather be fruitful to extend this project to areas with prior presence of Oak Foundation and its partners. It is assumed that the prior rapport with communities in such area would ensure an initial thrust during the inception of the project. However, alongside Kalimpong, were targeting Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling to bring under the purview of the project. .9.Rationale behind initial 6 months of researchThe project shall be undertaking 4 initial researches within the first 6 months. They include Baseline Study on Program Indicators, Need Assessment on Oak Application Form     20Energy Requirements in Tea Garden, Scoping study on the potential of livelihood enhancement of small tea growers as well as diversified livelihood options for tea garden workers, and Market study to identify appropriate technology solutions. Each of these studies (except the last one) would involve survey with around 1000 Households. We are allotting 45 days (effective 37 working days) for each of these studies. This would involve finalizing research methodology, research tools, training of enumerators, data tabulation, data cleaning, data analysis, draft report, internal peer review and final report. We would insist that same group of researcher would be conducting all four researches to ensure interconnectivity in research findings and same standard in all four knowledge products. Thus, research would be conducted one after another and would require 6 months.10.What are the possible DRE technologies that can be adopted in this projectSolar Power Systems: Installation of solar panels for generating electricity and meeting energy needs in tea gardens and associated facilities.Biogas Systems: Implementation of biogas plants to convert organic waste from tea gardens and livestock farming into biogas for cooking and heating purposes.Improved Cookstoves: Introducing energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce fuel consumption and indoor air pollution.Solar Water Heaters: Deploying solar water heating systems to provide hot water for various needs, such as bathing and kitchen use.Solar Dryers: Utilizing solar energy to power drying systems for tea leaves, spices, and herbs, enhancing the efficiency and quality of the drying process.Solar Water Pumps: Installing solar-powered water pumps for drinking/small irrigation purposes, reducing reliance on grid electricity or diesel pumps.Solar Power Sprayers: This Is to support the existing agro-technical need of the small tea growers.Energy-Efficient Lighting: Promoting the use of energy-efficient LED lighting systems in tea garden households and community spaces.Part B: 1.Which are the financing schemes (central/state) that can be harnessed for this proposed project and what are the modalities for doing so? Since this is the tea garden community with the only identity of being labourers, their eligibility for these schemes should be considered carefully.Applicable for Small Tea Growers -Major Central Schemes/Agencies - Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY), Tea Development & Promotion Scheme, Tea Board of India.Major State Schemes/Agencies - Financial Support Scheme for Farm Mechanization (FSSM), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchay Yojna (PMKSY), MIssion For Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), West Bengal State Rural Livelihoods Mission (WBSRLM)-Anandadhara, Bangla Swanirbhar Karmasansthan Prakalpa (BSKP), West Bengal Swanirbhar Sahayak Prakalpa, Karmo Bhumi Prakalpa, Yuvashree Arpan SchemeOak Application Form     21Applicable for Tea Garden Workers -Major Central Schemes/Agencies - Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY), Tea Development & Promotion SchemeMajor State Schemes/Agencies - West Bengal Swanirbhar Sahayak Prakalpa, Karmo Bhumi Prakalpa, Yuvashree Arpan Scheme, Chaai Sundari Scheme. Samajik Surakshya Yojana To harness the mentioned financial schemes, the modalities can include identifying eligible beneficiaries, conducting training programs, facilitating loan applications, collaborating with relevant government departments, and providing guidance on accessing the benefits.2.How the proposed programme can be positioned for generating traction with the administration and philanthropic sector as a pathway for improved living conditions, economic opportunities and climate adaptation? What are the opportunities?The proposed programme can be positioned as a comprehensive solution with following opportunities -Highlighting the alignment of the programme with government priorities and policies related to poverty alleviation, rural development, and climate change mitigation. A few such policies are mentioned below-1.Policy Framework for developing and promoting Decentralized Renewable Energy (DRE) Livelihood Applications in Rural Areas2.Policy on Co-generation and Generation of Electricity from Renewable Sources of Energy.3.State Climate Change Action Plan (SCCAP)4.West Bengal Startup PolicyDemonstrating the potential for positive socio-economic impacts through case studies, success stories, and data on livelihood improvements, income generation, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.Engaging with relevant government departments, local authorities, and philanthropic organizations through presentations, workshops, and stakeholder consultations to build partnerships and garner support.Showcasing the programme's potential for scalability and replication, emphasizing the long-term benefits and sustainability of the proposed interventions.3.Secondary information on the green jobs sector in West Bengal and elsewhere in India? Are there any strategic tie-ups with companies which produce these clean energy solutions for placement of youth?The renewable energy sector in India has witnessed significant growth, driven by government policies and initiatives like the National Solar Mission. Solar power has emerged as a major contributor to green job creation, with opportunities in solar panel manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. Also, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is being implemented in seven non-attainment cities in West Bengal. NCAP 2.0 is likely to create between 20,000 and 40,000 green jobs in West Bengal alone, opined experts at the India Clean Air Summit 2022 (ICAS 2022). As per a senior professor of IIT Kanpur, Oak Application Form     22an estimated 1 million green jobs are available within the air quality domain alone across India. Overall, India has the potential to create 35 million green jobs by the year 2047 in renewable energy, waste management, electric vehicles, green construction, and sustainable textiles in urban and peri-urban areas, according to a study launched by Skill Council for Green Jobs and Sattva Consulting and supported by J.P. Morgan(https://www.millenniumpost.in/kolkata/bengal-to-create-20k-to-40k-green-jobs-in-next-few-years-490996?infinitescroll=1)(http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/100318337.cms?from=mdr&utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)On the other hand, The central government's focus on electric mobility has led to the emergence of green jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing, charging infrastructure development, and battery technology. Government initiatives like the Skill India Mission and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's skill development programs aim to bridge the skill gap and create a pool of trained professionals for the green sector. Additionally, programs like the Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) provide training and certification in specific green job roles. According to available data, entry-level technicians in renewable energy sectors can earn an average salary ranging from INR 15,000 to INR 30,000 per month. With experience and specialization, the salary range can increase. The government's commitment to renewable energy and sustainable development, coupled with global efforts to combat climate change, will continue to drive demand for skilled workers in green industries. Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) is an indicator towards the same.Indias solar and wind energy sectors employed 1,64,000 workers as of FY22, showing a 47% increase from FY21. 84% of this workforce is in the solar energy sector.. Solar energy alone accounted for the largest share of green jobs in India, employing over 120,000 people in various roles such as manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. By 2030, it is projected that the EV sector in India will create around 10 million jobs across the value chain, including manufacturing, assembly, battery production, and charging infrastructure.As per a very recent Business Standard article this month, a study conducted by NLB Services claim that demand for green jobs in India is projected to grow at a rate of 15-20% annually over the next decade. This growth trajectory suggests that India has the potential to create 30-32 million green jobs by 2050. The increasing demand for green jobs is primarily motivated by India's ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. (Source: https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/demand-for-green-jobs-to-rise-15-20-every-year-in-next-decade-report-123060100451_1.html)ON Skills, a social venture spun off from Environment Conservation Society, has obtained empanelments with esteemed entities such as the Skill Council for Green Jobs, Agriculture Skill Council of India, National Institute of Solar Energy, and DDUGKY. The sectors where students have been trained are Retail, IT-ITES, Hospitality & Tourism sector, Solar PV Installer(Suryamitra) and Solar pump technician(Varun Mitra). Furthermore, ON Skills has established tie-ups with 12 companies (50% of them are  direct manufacturers of Clean Energy Solutions and rest 50% are placement companies associated with such manufacturers).4.What are the proposed indicators to assess the outcomes?Oak Application Form     23Qualitative IndicatorsEnhanced awareness of communities on knowledge related to renewable energy-based technology solutions and related utilities w.r.t. existing livelihood and living conditions (health, education, water, safety, and security)Augmented participation of communities for diversification plan for livelihood enhancement.Community institutions representatives have enhanced interaction with external stakeholders to facilitate resource (schemes, finance, and technology) linkage.Youths become more aware about and involved in suitable green job avenue, associated potential income, and their suitability for association.Quantitative IndicatorsGreater participation of women in adopting renewable energy based technology solution aided livelihood value chain through participation.Increased number of linkages with market traders established by strengthening community institutions.Enhanced uptake of renewable energy based technology solution to improve the living conditions and strengthen at least one livelihood value chain.Informed policy/implementation guidelines adapted by stakeholders at local, state and national level to facilitate seamless resource (schemes, finance, and technology) and market linkages for tea garden communities.",

(300 words):Oak Application Form     5BAT is governed and overseen by our Board of Trustees, sub-committees and Advisory Councils, with day-to-day management delegated to our Senior Management Team. The Board, which meets every two months, is led by the Chair and is made up of seven members with extensive experience from business, finance, civil society, international development, communications and government.  The Board sub-committees provide greater oversight and guidance in specific areas: the Programmes and Partnerships Committee (focused on BATs programmes); the Finance & Risk Committee; the Social Finance Committee; and the Governance, Nominations and Remuneration Committee. Each committee includes Board Members with key areas of expertise, as well as external experts.We have 50 full-time or full-time equivalent paid employees, based in the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. BAT is committed to encouraging an equal, diverse, and inclusive working environment where all individuals are treated fairly, with dignity and respect. We have an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) policy, which guides our approach. Practically this means that BAT:    Seeks diversity of knowledge, background and experience in recruiting employees;      Values flexible working patterns;     Promotes a culture where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity and are offered equal opportunities;      Educates itself about EDI best practices     Reviews and monitors diversity as part of our aim of discouraging any discriminatory behaviour or practices. BAT has a robust set of policies which cover the following areas: Whistleblowing, bullying and harassment, code of conduct and safeguarding. We have an EDI Group with representation from our country offices which looks at how EDI is integrated into our work and policies.  In India, the team has registered significant growth over the past year and this trend will continue as we further develop our in-country Child Protection, Social Finance and Conservation portfolios. Additionally, the British Asian India Foundation, instituted in 2017 and registered as a Section 8 Company, has been set up with the aim to drive and further scale BATs impact in India.

Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)Oak Application Form     6Since BATs inception, we have pioneered a disruptive and non-traditional approach to development. Inspired by our sector leading social finance initiatives, all our programmes are focused on and driven by outcomes, which ensures that we deliver results at pace for the most underserved communities across South Asia. Through our child protection programme in India, BAT has successfully brought together the public, private and voluntary sectors to trial community-led, sustainable solutions, which have supported 486,000 vulnerable children and young women in 2021-2022. Some of our key achievements in this area include:BAT was one of the key partners at the heart of the Child Labour Free Jaipur coalition to address the prevalence of child labour. As result of our efforts, there was greater enforcement of child labour laws, which led to a 70% increase in the number of children rescued from child labour, and 15 convictions over four years  an unprecedented achievement, and a significant deterrent for traffickers.Our Prevention Model implemented in West Bengal has demonstrated impact in mitigating trafficking. We observed increased participation of young people and families - 4,000 young people in collectives, 1,091 active Community-based Institutions (CBIs); improved capacity among CBIs to support vulnerable children - 43% of child protection cases and 73% of at-risk cases of trafficking were resolved by CBIs; and improved living conditions through access to entitlements - 82% of beneficiaries people who applied for job cards saw an increase in monthly income.Through our work with the Jharkhand Anti-Trafficking Network, a coalition of 13 organisations, we have reached out to over 20,000 community members to promote safe migration and prevent trafficking.We have also recently launched a strategic partnership with the Childrens Investment Fund Foundation to develop an ambitious Child Protection Programme, which will leverage significant support to strengthen the child protection ecosystem in India and reduce exploitation of children by 30%.5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Evidence suggests that the tea garden districts of northern West Bengal are likely source and transit points along the migration and trafficking corridor. Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts in particular, share porous borders with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and with north-east India, making them likely hubs for trafficking and unsafe migration.There are nearly 250 tea gardens across the three districts employing over 2.2 lakh workers, around 10% of which have been declared sick or shut down. Tea garden workers have been systemically exploited, often denied the minimum Oak Application Form     7wage or entitlements such as provident fund and gratuity. Debt is offered in advance and offset against wages, trapping them in a vicious cycle. Child labour is rampant with many children being employed at 50% of the minimum wage for adults in peak season. Poverty, illiteracy, school dropouts, unemployment, under-employment, exploitation of workers (low wages, unpaid wages and benefits) are issues that are commonly seen. Poor implementation of social protection schemes further marginalises and disenfranchises them. As a result, the region witnesses high rates of out-migration, including that of young people to faraway destinations without the knowledge or support of their families, making them vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. Between 1992 and 2015, over 2.5 lakh people migrated out of tea gardens.Within the state, 21.43% of the population is multi-dimensionally poor. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the crisis, with many families deprioritising health, nutrition, and education. The Annual State of Education Report for West Bengal 2021 estimates that 3.5% of children aged 15 to 16 years have either dropped out of school or never been enrolled. The National Family Health Survey V also paints a sordid picture on the health and nutritional indicators for children, and points to a prevalence of early marriage and gender-based violence. From 2016-2020, 8,000 children were reported missing from the state every year, and children account for 75% of cases of victims trafficked and victims rescued in 2020. CHILDLINE data also points to a high number of trafficking cases  23% of cases in 2019-20 were reported from West Bengal. Due to the recent division of districts, child protection structures such as Child Welfare Committees, Anti-Human Trafficking Units, shelter homes etc. are inadequate. Grassroots structures such as Village-level Child Protection Committees are inactive as well. With tea gardens being privately managed and far from the district headquarters, it is also challenging for stakeholders to make inroads with the community for monitoring and vigilance. BAT in partnership with The Hummingbird Foundation has developed a Prevention of Trafficking Model that has demonstrated impact in mitigating trafficking in West Bengal. The premise is that collective action by key stakeholdersyoung people, parents, community-based institutions and local governmentleads to transformative community action and ultimately 'systems change to reduce the risk of trafficking. We believe that this model, with certain adaptations, can also serve to reduce the vulnerabilities that lead to unsafe migration.We seek to roll out an integrated programme in Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Darjeeling districts (selected after gathering secondary data and inputs from organisations, researchers and government stakeholders working in the region), that draws together children (6 to 18 years), young people (18 to 24 years), families, community-based institutions such as Self Help Groups, children and youth groups, School Management Communities, Tea Garden Associations, migrant workers and state actors; builds their capacity to take collective action; and bridges the gaps in convergence between stakeholders. We will engage with 3 lakh community members, including 1.2 lakh children across 8 blocks in 3 districts, and will leverage on their local knowledge and strengths to design interventions that are best suited to the local context. We will convene a safe migration and counter trafficking network of implementing partners and resource organisations who hold strong Oak Application Form     8community linkages and knowledge at different levels (panchayat, block and district), collaboratively working towards a common goal of mitigating trafficking and unsafe migration. Key interventions that are planned include community mobilisation; awareness generation; collectivisation and strengthening of grassroots child protection structures; empowerment of children and young people; facilitating linkages to entitlements; vocational training; and capacity building, engagement and advocacy with ecosystem stakeholders and government systems.  The recent notifications issued by the Ministry of Women and Child Development on the Mission Vatsalya Implementation Guidelines, and by the West Bengal Government on the Modified Guidelines for Child Protection Committees in West Bengal, also serve as proof that the conditions are favourable to work with grassroots structures. Additionally, one of the selected implementing partners, CINI, has been appointed by the West Bengal government as one of the nodal agencies responsible for implementing the modified guidelines.",

        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):BAT will bring together a coalition of organisations comprising Child In Need Institute, Child Rights and You, FXB Suraksha and Nirmana, to build a collaborative model that will address vulnerabilities and gaps in service delivery at various points along the source-transit-destination corridor, with a common goal to prevent trafficking and other child rights violations and promote safe migration. The implementing partners have been selected based on their track record of working on issues on child protection and safe migration in the region, at different levels of governance (panchayat, block and district). Our selected partners have extensive expertise across a broad range of issues, including social protection, livelihoods and behaviour change, which will add value to the project. BAT will regularly convene our implementing partners and government stakeholders, to facilitate knowledge exchange and ensure that inputs from the grassroots are fed upwards to policy makers.BAT is committed to a bottom-up approach to all our programmes, to ensure that communities we serve have a voice in programme design. BATs partners will meet with communities on a regular basis, so that we can receive feedback and alter our approach as needed. We will establish a community-led safety net and build capacities of children and communities to empower them to take ownership of issues that affect them and hold state actors accountable, so that beneficiaries receive their entitlements.Given BATs partnership with the Childrens Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), a grant from the Oak Foundation is likely to be matched 1:1 by CIFF. The matched funding will allow BAT to layer on complementary interventions that will add significant depth and scale to the activities supported by the Oak Foundation, thus achieving greater impact.",

If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):Monitoring and Evaluation:The project will have a comprehensive Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning framework, in line with what BAT developed for the pilot of our Prevention of Trafficking model in West Bengal. We will layer outcomes and indicators related to safe migration onto this framework, so that change resulting from both the prevention and migration aspects of the project is adequately measured.BAT will work with an external evaluator to carry out the baseline and endline study. Targets and outcome indicators will be set post the baseline study and the endline study will be carried out in Year 4.Quarterly review meetings will be carried out with all partners to identify and troubleshoot any challenges faced during programme implementation. Progress of partners will be reviewed and plans for the next quarter will be drawn up during these meetings. Building on our current safeguarding policies and practice, we will ensure that all partners have appropriate policies and procedures in place to prevent and respond to any safeguarding concerns.We are also putting in place a Project Management Unit (PMU) in West Bengal which will be responsible for coordination with partners, monitoring for effective programme implementation and convening network meetings. The PMU will monitor the projects progress against outcomes, financial management, and cost-efficiency.Learning:BAT's PMU will have monthly and quarterly review sessions with Partner organisations. These review meetings also attempt to learn from the program's execution to identify what works and what doesn't, as well as the possibilities of scaling up this programme across the state of West Bengal.",

We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):Oak Application Form     13Risks:Changes in India's regulatory framework: Since Oak will be supporting British Asian Trust, which is registered in the UK, changes in India's regulatory environment will not have a bearing on our operations. We will also distribute monies to partners every six months to mitigate any impact from regulatory risk.Political environment: General elections are scheduled for 2024, and this may impact our work with government systems in the second year of the programme. Restrictions on gatherings during elections are also likely to have an impact on our work with groups and collectives. We will pivot our interventions based on the political context. Convergence between a consortium of groups with diverse ideologies: BAT will organise a series of strategy and network-building activities and workshops for partner organisations, which will allow them to work toward a common goal set collaboratively by everyone.Opposition from tea garden associations: BATs implementing partners have had previous experience of working with tea garden associations and will be able to facilitate meaningful dialogue and solicit cooperation from these associations.Safeguarding:  To mitigate against any safeguarding risks, BAT will train all our partners using BATs robust safeguarding policy. This will include ensuring communities and project participants are aware of communication mechanisms to highlight an issue and procedures are in place to effectively respond.Opportunities:Partnership with CIFF: BAT has partnered with CIFF to develop a pioneering new Child Protection Programme, with the aim of reducing exploitation of children in seven high prevalence states. Through trialling innovative solutions, scaling-up tested models and sharing best practice with key stakeholders, this partnership will contribute to creating a more robust and collaborative child protection eco-system across India.Strong connect with the West Bengal Government:  BAT has a good relationship with West Bengal's Ministry of Women and Child Development, which we will leverage to help implement the programme and scale-it up to other areas in the state.",

What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):The Problem: AIF along with BBC partners intends to address the problem of Low Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) in Rural India: At a policy level, Ministries such as Women and Child Development have schemes like E-Haat, Rashtriya Mahila Kosh and Swayam Siddha Kosh project among others made a sincere effort to encourage women entrepreneurship. However, despite the positive conversations and concrete steps being taken around the issue, it has unfortunately not translated into a conducive entrepreneurship ecosystem for women. There are a multitude of barriers that are a hindrance to the social progress of women as entrepreneurs. These include but are not limited to the inherent bias against womens business skills, conventional gender roles rooted in patriarchal mindsets, and lack of access to finance and networks, among others. Refer detailed research report in the attachment. Deeply embedded gender norms among other sociocultural issues deprive women of access to information, market knowledge, finance, and most importantly, paid employment.According to a 2019 report by Google and Bain & Company, women were already worst hit by Indias unemployment crisis. While the overall Indian unemployment rate was at 7 percent before Indias March 2020 lockdown, it was already as high as 18 percent for women. Post the devastating impact of the COVID 19 on Indias economy and the widening job crises, the FLFPR of India dropped to a historic low of 16.1% during the July-September 2020 quarter, the lowest among the major economies. In 2021, as the COVID pandemic hit jobs and the economy, less than 16.1% of Indian women were part of the countrys labour force (Reuters, 2021). This is among the lowest rates of womens workforce participation in the world. Today, only Yemen, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Algeria, Iran, and the West Bank and Gaza have lower FLFPR than India.Rationale for Formative Phase: BBC partners entered into the formative phase with a hypothesis that the micro, small, medium enterprise (MSME) Oak Application Form     8sector can play a significant role in accelerating rural women's entrepreneurship, such that they can leverage digital and climate-resilient technologies, access government schemes and provisions and lead inclusive value chains to demonstrate an increase in FLFPR. To do so, BBC partners main objective were to learn following broader aspects to design gender-sensitive programs via addressing following informational gaps:Identification of key enabling factors for the ecosystem to address systemic challenges, BBC partners will identify opportunities through research findings and strengthen networks for accelerating growth of mid-high impact, mid-high potential RWE.Approaches to strengthen and identification of best models to scale-up for viable and potential RWE and micro-enterprises. We intended to learn how and where in the value chain we can transform the lives of women by offering technical wherewithal, finance/market support, and network connections besides building and assisting strong narrative support to amplify RWE voices in policy discourse.Landscape analysis to identify new/existing opportunities as entry points for RWE through continuous engagement to build their product, value proposition, networks capacity, and building linkages for sustainable businesses.Identification of Problems through Formative Phase (8 months): From June 2022 to January 2023, Start-Up!, New Delhi a private consultancy, and Indian Institute of Bank Management (IIBM), Guwahati a premier institute conducted a mixed method primary and secondary research study to ascertain barriers to entry for women entrepreneurs, gender norms, policy frameworks, motivations and efficacy of government interventions. Start Up! designed and conducted In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with 25 sector experts and dialogue sessions with a total of 166 rural women entrepreneurs (RWE) comprising of 96 RWE in Assam and 70 RWE in West Bengal. The RWE interviewed by Start Up! was largely in stages 0-3 (stage 0- seed stage, 1- self-employed or striving, 2-start-up, 3 - stable or steadfast) of entrepreneurship. Less than 5% of RWE were in stage 4 of scale and sector-shaper entrepreneurship. Given the current scenario, its relevant for BBC to uplift RWE struggling in stage 0-3. Please refer to page 4 and from page number 24 - 33 of the research report of Start Up! to know more about the various stages of entrepreneurship. IIBMs research (which is currently ongoing), includes both secondary and primary sources, across 5 districts in Assam (Kamrup Rural, Nalbari, Baksa, Goalpara and Sivsagar) and 3 districts in West Bengal (Coochbehar, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling). There are 6 value chains that the research has focused on, namely, Mushroom, Piggery, Floriculture, Dairy, Handloom and Tea. IIBM has intensively engaged with a total of 300 Women Entrepreneurs (50 women entrepreneurs from each value chain) along with 20 stakeholder consultations which includes aggregators from Mushroom and Piggery value chain, Eri Silk producer company, Tea Board officials, company promoting floriculture, tea brokers, handloom designers and market aggregators, Micro Finance Institutions. At RWE level, our key research and findings from pilot suggests:Stereotypical gender roles: In the Edelgive Foundation study, 70% of the 1,235 women entrepreneurs admitted that domestic workload was Oak Application Form     9their primary responsibility. Most women felt that it was against their culture/values to let their husband/other family members partake in household chores.Top value chains for women: In the state of Assam and West Bengal there is a huge untapped potential for upward mobility of RWE in the following value chains : oIn Assam: Tea with a special focus on small tea growers (women) and handloom.oIn Assam and West Bengal: Livestock (pig, goat, poultry).oIn West Bengal: Dairy and agriculture.oEco-tourism and cultural tourism were identified as areas of huge potential in Assam.Access to information through digital skills: RWE do not have access to appropriate information or guidance which is specific to their business. It needs to be mentioned that most of the RWE are so involved in the operationalisation of their business that their attempts to seek additional information are rather limited. oIn Assam (92%) and West Bengal (87%) RWE strongly feel that lack of digital skill is an obstacle in expanding their business.Business skills for running an enterprise: Women usually run their enterprise as an informal entity and are not able to implement their business management skills in formalising their entities owing to lack of skills, mentoring and coaching support. oIn Assam (67%) and West Bengal (60%) RWE admitted that lack of business knowledge and financial constraints contribute to stunted growth of their enterprise.Risk taking aptitude with respect to finance and business expansion:  RWE do not demonstrate risk taking aptitude while managing their businesses. The average investment in starting their enterprise is INR 18,705 and almost 20% did not invest anything (Edelgive Foundation study). Further from this study, it was revealed that only 9% of them took some loan. Women revealed that they do not want to take loans because of the fear of inability to repay the loan, which would negatively impact their family and family pride. Since women do not have assets in their name, a large majority (83%) also feel that they cannot mortgage assets to secure loans, if required. This majorly deters women from taking loans. Further, 1% of women have availed of any government scheme and this is primarily because just about 11% are aware of any schemes. Less than a third (29%) of those who applied, could avail the scheme.  Considering a large proportion of women did not consider applying to the schemes even if aware (79%), they were asked the reason behind this. Major reasons cited by these women were: non-availability of required documents (17%), thought the process is complex (15%), did not feel the need for any support (13%), and believed that such schemes are only to support the rich (7%). oThe lack of financing remains the chief concern - 90 percent of women entrepreneurs in the country rely on informal sources of financing.Oak Application Form     10oIn Assam (83%) and West Bengal (60%), RWE are not aware of any financial linkage opportunities and an abysmal percentage (10-20%) in both states are aware of the government benefits for RWE (as per Start-Up study).Our Proposed Approach: Based on the reports, research findings and our collaborative partner's experience in the sector, we know that women's entrepreneurship is a significant tool of empowerment for women, and through BBC we want to create an urge within the stakeholders across the board to support this and contribute to the cause. We intend to do this through ecosystem transformation by shifting the mindset (where entrepreneurship become aspirational), infusion of innovation, establishment of formal-informal RWE associations/hubs, and creation of new evidence based knowledge products for dissemination at two intervention levels:At the 3P (Policy-Players-Processes) Ecosystem Design Level: We want to align our focus on bankers, financial, social, technology institutions and regulators to design and develop new products and processes for including women entrepreneurs from diverse socio-economic profiles in value chains.At an Operational Demonstration-Delivery Level: We seek investments for long-term training, coaching and mentorship of women entrepreneurs to build access to capital, markets, and technologies for women entrepreneurs to scale. This will help in the co-creation of multiplying social/ professional networks of grassroots business women and develop women entrepreneurs voices and capacity to influence economic and developmental agendas.At each level, as per the strength of respective BBC partner and collective effort, our findings confirmed that five thematic capitals most influence RWE on various stages of entrepreneurship lifecycle (seed, self-employed, start-up, stable and scale up) and are worth investing in:1.Personhood Capital : Autonomy or self/personhood. Celebrate and recognize rural women entrepreneurs locally, at district-levels and across states through running media campaigns to share stories of the true contribution of RWE.2.Knowledge Capital: Competencies or knowledge, skills. Non-conventional business management, mentoring and business leadership programs  programs that are local and accessible, rooted in the RWE context, with faculty that comprises technical experts as well as role model RWE.3.Financial Capital: Access and control over resources, or ownership of capital, assets tools and technology. Building narratives that build the confidence of bankers in RW as credit-worthy and sound investment opportunity.4.Social Capital: Relationships or personal and professional social networks for collectivization to organize trade fairs, summits to amplify voice and act as pressure groups to negotiate with family, market, government etc.Oak Application Form     115.Recognition Capital: Increase RWEs reputation capital in their locus of control and influence through stories, films and awards. In addition to this, BBC strongly recommends following value chain agnostic inputs are necessary for rural women to become entrepreneurs:1. Recognition for them that they are individuals who breathe life and have all the potential to do what they want.2. Access to awareness and knowledge on what are possibilities for them to do in their limited environments and unlimited responsibilities.3. Negotiations skill within the family to get time off to do what they choose to do.4. Enabling environment of women and others who will build and amplify the above.5. Working capital initially.6. Money management and financial literacy.7. Access to bank accounts.Using Oaks Funding: With this context, through BBC partners, we seek to boost the entrepreneurial spirit in women and plot womens entrepreneurship as one of the key pathways to advance womens economic empowerment in India. It also aims to get stakeholders across the board including the government, corporate, academia, think tanks, sector experts, philanthropy, investors, funding agencies, and not-for-profit sector together because we believe that it is only through synchronized efforts would we be able to create a thriving transformational ecosystem for rural women entrepreneurship. AIF in the capacity of an intermediary partner is requesting funds from Oak Foundation to commission:A planning phase (9-12 months) will focus on the following activities necessary towards effective implementation: a. Onboarding of program teamb. Conducting individual scoping studies by the individual partners to initiate their interventionsc. Formalization and constitution of the different committees and functions within the BBC. Further details on this maybe referred to in Page no. 44 in the BBC Strategic Program Design document, as enclosed with this proposal.d. A Resource Mobilisation Plan which will include a toolkit for the partners to refer to with respect to the different areas from where resources may be leveraged, different types of resources that can be leveraged, and what stages.e. A robust MEL plan will be owned by the Strategic Programme Management Committee (SPMC), and an agency will be onboarded for external evaluation of the program.6. An implementation phase (13 - 32 months) which will include demonstration and generating evidence from pilots covering select value chains; engaging with ecosystem players; Oak Application Form     12orchestrating mobilisation of RWEs within and across value chains; and design and roll out the communication strategy.7.Consolidation phase (33-48 months) : focus on the sustainability of the initiative. This will include documentation, dissemination and capacity building for greater adoption and promotion of successful strategies. Resource mobilisation to sustain and grow the outcomes will be a key focus area.During the implementation phase when BBC is able to demonstrate transformative change in a small (in relative terms) number of RWE in select value chains; during and after the consolidation phase, BBC would amplify the impact of its models through the following key allies:1. The MSME space2. Market systems3. Officers specific to the market systems4. Banks or rural credit facilities5. Large organisations in civil society like SEWA and others to see how they have cracked what they have6. NRLM kind of initiatives for linkage7. Mens groups in the village levelsEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion: Yes, AIF is committed to addressing it. All the BBC partners are chosen to bring equity in opportunities, diversity in choosing the target population, and inclusion of otherwise marginalized RWE. The unique value addition from BBC is that its designed to work at the intersection of finance and empowerment with an imperative to understand the economics behind entrepreneurship to create an enabling and conducive environment for women-owned enterprises. In other women-focused interventions, usually few elements are addressed that too in silos and more importantly, from a social lens only. For RWE to be successful, enterprises need to be nurtured where they are with skills relevant to the local context.",

        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):Engagement in Partnerships: Every collaborating organization of BBC is committed to delivering a set of inter-connected and synergistic programs, which together lead to the shared outcomes and outputs of the initiative. To strengthen and sustain the collaboration, BBC will require a set of strategic and cross-cutting functions, which will be facilitated with CURIE (creativity, unity, respect, integrity and excellence) values embedded in the principles of result oriented transformational leadership  a leadership that is driven on achieving success through big vision thinking and intellectual stimulation to create a thriving, openly communicative work culture. The process is participative and inclusive of skilled sector experts/ competent organizations and professionals across sectors who may be outside existing BBC partners as the need arises and is committed to weave in cultural competency through involvement of local communities for better acceptability of interventions.Right Mix of Diverse Partners: One of the prime criteria for selecting partners has been their non-profit structure, strong roots in the local community through direct implementation of programs in close collaboration with local governance structures. The list of BBC members is not limited to the list and may continue to expand in the implementation phase based on synergetic alignment of priorities:1.AIFT, Gurgaon: Award winning non-profit. AIFT is committed to help create an India free from poverty, one in which everyone has access to affordable education, health care and livelihood opportunities.2.Centre for Education and Communication (CEC), New Delhi: Founded in 1982, CEC is a resource centre dedicated to research, campaign and support on key concepts, ideas and policies that enhance dignified and sustainable livelihood options of workers, in particular informal workers, and small producers.3.Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF), New Delhi:  DEF is an integral digital action organization which creates information Oak Application Form     19empowerment, equitable communities by providing digital access to information, knowledge and contextual capacity.4.Selco Foundation, Bengaluru: Pioneer in delivery of sustainable energy to the poor in India in a manner that creates assets and results in long term poverty alleviation.5.Switch On Foundation, Kolkata: An award winning not for profit organization. Since 2008, SwitchON Foundation has led many innovative projects and incubated a number of highly successful ventures and initiatives in the areas of renewable energy access, agriculture and livelihoods, skilling and education and environment and climate change.6.The Goat Trust, Lucknow: The Goat Trust works across value chain of Goat based products. We promote small livestock (Goat/sheep/ Backyard birds rearing) based livelihood through demystifying production technology, building institutions and promoting standard of marketing and linkage.Newer Ways of Working Through Collaborative Building: To achieve the highly complex layered multi-stakeholder solution of uplifting women through economic empowerment at an ecosystem level in India, AIF is proposing to work through a collaborative as opposed to an individual organization. A collaborative is a temporary alliance or partnering of groups in order to achieve a common purpose or to engage in joint activity. Forming collaboratives with other groups of similar values, interests, and goals will allow AIF and BBC members to combine their resources and become more powerful than when they each acted alone and therefore increase their collective potential for success. AIF further believes that a collaborative can bring more expertise and resources to bear on complex issues, where the technical or personnel resources of any one organization would not be sufficient.",

How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL): As mentioned in the Ways of Working strategy of the BBC, the Strategic Programme Management Committee (SPMC) will be constituted which will be represented by the senior leadership of the member organisations. The SPMC will be responsible for anchoring outcomes, outputs and learning of the BBC and will own the larger MEL framework. The SPMC will be the representative of BBC members Oak Application Form     20and will ensure continuous monitoring and feeding of learning happens for improvement. A monitoring and evaluation partner will be onboarded to work in collaboration and consultation with the newly formed SPMC and Project Secretariat under the aegis of AIFT to ensure measurement of success metrics. Evaluation and learning at regular intervals would be undertaken by a third-party organization selected by the competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process by AIFT in consultation with the SPMC to maintain objectivity and data integrity.Regular reviews will be held where the ToC, which is a dynamic document, will be reviewed to ensure that the BBC programmatic strategy is aligned and learnings are incorporated into the strategy on an ongoing basis.Additionally, a dashboard will be created which will be anchored by the SPMC and whose access will be provided to all BBC members. The Secretariat will be responsible for regularly updating and maintaining the dashboard and ensuring that data from the ground is captured effectively. Please refer page number 43 of the attached strategy document for the complete monitoring, evaluation and learning metrics, which will demonstrate signs of success.As the work progresses, BBC members will ensure the intended impact on the target population is occurring and adaptations are made to stay on course. For more details, please refer to page number 39 to 41 of BBC strategy document.Learning: BBC partners are entering into the implementation phase with a hypothesis that the micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) sector can play a significant role in accelerating rural women's entrepreneurship, such that they can leverage digital and climate-resilient technologies, access government schemes and provisions and lead inclusive value chains to demonstrate economic empowerment of rural women through entrepreneurship. To do so, BBC partners will learn the following broader aspects to design gender-sensitive programs via:Key enabling factors for the ecosystem to address systemic challenges, BBC partners will leverage on identified opportunities basis formative phase research findings and strengthen networks for accelerating growth of existing and potential RWE at various life cycle of entrepreneurship.Approaches to strengthen and identification of best models to scale up for viable and potential RWE and micro-enterprises. We intend to demonstrate how, where and what in the value chain we can bring transformational ecosystem change to impact the lives of women by offering technical wherewithal, finance/market support, and network connections besides building and assisting strong narrative support to amplify RWE voices in policy discourse.Landscape analysis to identify new/existing opportunities as entry points for RWE through continuous engagement to build their product, value proposition, networks capacity and building linkages for sustainable businesses.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESOak Application Form     21What are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):1. Research suggests women who earn in rural areas are more prone to gender-based domestic violence as there is a constant power struggle as to who will own the money and spend it. The BBC program will have to allocate resources to enhance provision of social security services for existing and emerging RWE to minimize the impact of risk factors at the household level.2. Entrepreneurship development is a long-term resource-intensive game, besides in a collaborative-based partnership disagreement on a mutual goal and objective can threaten the success of the program. Therefore, rather than focusing on short-term quantitative outputs, the grant program could focus on longer-term outcomes over a period of 5-10 years since ecosystem players on the groundwork in fragmented ways.3. Working with governments is imperative, yet hard. Organizations would need time and capacity building to focus on systems change and engage other stakeholders in congruent ways. Mainstream adoption of models will not move unless backed by data and evidence. This would require investment in research, business case development, and creating a new and strategic narrative for RWE.4. At an operational level, forming and managing a collaborative can be a very time-consuming and bureaucratic process that can take away time from working directly on campaign issues and organization tasks. To mitigate this risk, AIF will encourage democratic decision-making and sustained action by managing power dynamics within the group through transparent communication and appreciative inquiry for best practices, strategic planning, and organizational culture to increase the momentum of initiatives.5. At a socio-political level, a high turnover rate among government officials in the strategic positions of influence will hamper the advocacy agenda at the ecosystem level. This is beyond BBC partners' locus of control; however, efforts will be made to strengthen partnerships at multiple levels to sustain relationships.",

Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, governance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):AID is a volunteer driven organisation based in the US with thirty chapters and about 400 volunteers. There is a Board of Directors with six members currently. All board members are long-time volunteers with ten to twenty years experience within AID. There is an elected Executive Board (EB) consisting of nine to ten members and elected for a term of two years, responsible for operation and coordination across chapters. There are two full time Development Coordinators based in the US, who spend a few months working with the partners in India as well. Another full time person works with our partners in eastern India and is based in Kolkata. There are five Jeevansaathis who work full time on various issues and across India. They were long-time AID volunteers in the US who have gone back and started work at the grassroots decades ago. AID works with close to 75 grassroots organizations across India on agriculture, health, education, gender and environmental justice. Currently AID has a part time accountant based in India helping us. AID is looking to hire a part time person in the US as well within the next 2 months. About 37% of the leadership is women. There is a conscious effort to increase diversity along the lines of faith, gender and caste.Grant Application Form, July 1 201356b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):AID was started in 1991 as a volunteer-based organization at College Park, Maryland by students from India interested in community development and social justice. Over the years the idea behind AID appealed to many and interested people formed chapters in many cities in the US. Today there are 30 chapters with about 400 volunteers. AID began by supporting grassroots NGOs working in under-served areas. As AID grew, so did its network at the grassroots in India. We understood the interconnected nature of the problems and the need to work with the most marginalized communities on health, education, agriculture, gender and the environment. Today, along with its partners, AID reaches out directly to several million people and strives to strengthen communities under their own leadership. A few prominent efforts:1. The Eureka educational program in Tamil Nadu was designed to improve the quality of education, particularly math, science and language, in marginalized communities. This program works with 80,000 children through 1,000 village educational centers throughout Tamil Nadu.2. In 2009 Cyclone Aila inundated the islands the Sunderbans in W Bengal with saline water. During initial relief efforts, AID realized that reviving agriculture was critical to the communitys well-being. Starting with 25 farmers in 2009 today AID has worked with 25,000 farmers and helped them adopt sustainable organic agriculture. It has also facilitated sales of the organic produce in Kolkata.In 2018, AID initiated a community based program on watershed development in 4 tribal districts of Jharkhand, bringing together grassroots groups and a resource organization. The project had a tremendous impact in its first year itself bringing water and greenery to some of the drought stricken villages and over the last two years. There has been a lot of demand from the neighboring villages but we are limited by funds. In these 2 years we have treated close to 3000 hectares of land Grant Application Form, July 1 20136and planted about 3000 trees and hope for it to scale.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):AID works with marginalized communities and groups across India to address issues they currently face. Through experience over the last two decades, AID has learnt that the issues are cross-cutting and its support should not be limited to single issues, but rather towards an overall dignified life for the communities. Agriculture: The majority of Indias population still has livelihoods based on agriculture and yet, farmers have been in distress for over a decade. AID has been addressing the agrarian crisis in India by -1. By providing relief to farmers in crisis: AID helps families of farmers who have committed suicide and those affected by natural disasters, by providing immediate support as well as logistical support to interface with the administration. AID has worked with farmers after several natural disasters helping them reclaim their land and restart agriculture. AID is working in Sunderbans as we speak to revive agriculture after Cyclone Amphan.2. By promoting sustainable practices:  AID helps to train farmers to move away from chemical farming towards ecologically sustainable and economically viable techniques. AID also works with landless families and tribal communities to improve food security through the practice of nutrition gardens.3.

By the end of 3 years, a majority of the Gram Sabhas in the entire work area will be meeting regularly with participation of women and youth. The Gram Sabhas will be engaged in filing the CFRs.2. Empowered with the knowledge of FRA, the community will be more assertive about their rights both at individual and community level. In the past they have resisted clear felling of trees on community land. In terms of individual rights, we can expect people to use their constitutional rights like filing police complaints against harassment and intimidation.3. Community forest mapping will help the community in conservation as well as in improving livelihoods (eg using bamboo or other NTFPs sustainably). This will also help them in asserting their rights on the community forests Grant Application Form, July 1 20139Timeframe:  ( Y1 - July 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )3. Organize 20 community level meetings in villages. 6 district level meetings and 1 state level meeting every year.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - throughout the year / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )4. Organize an annual alliance building meeting with similar and like minded organizations across the country.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - June 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )5. The site selection and the learning centers will be in areas where the Gram Sabhas have been activated in the past. A village level leadership committee will be formed to make the Gram Sabha functional regularly through a community process so that it has meetings at a democratically decided frequency and the minutes of the assembly are preserved. Women will be in the leadership role in these committees.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Dec 2020 / Y2 - No  / Y3 - No )6. Organize the mapping of the community forests to apply for Community Forest Rights (CFR) to the District Magistrate or the Sub Divisional officer.

Objective 2 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1. More than 15 indigenous communities live in the forest villages. None of the communities are engaged in mainstream agricultural practices as we see in Gangetic alluvial plain. We expect to involve these diverse forest dwelling communities into a new livelihood opportunity through cluster farming. At the end of 3 years the selected community members will have a secure source of income from farming.2. This sustainable organic farming is based on the idea of agroecological farming which includes different techniques of soil and water management, intercropping, mix cropping, promotion and cultivation of indigenous varieties, drip irrigation, mulching, preparation of organic manure, composting, integrated crop management. At the end of 3 years farmers involved in the cluster will learn to grow crops organically in a sustainable Grant Application Form, July 1 2013107.2.c. Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Activites: 1.Community mobilization:The entire livelihood initiative through cluster farming is going to be implemented in a democratic way through the process of participatory decision making by the Gram Sabha (GS). The GS will identify interested farmers and the common land for farming. This mobilization process involves regular meetings and interaction with the respected GS in the village in order to convince them to take up and monitor this activity as the absolute decision making authority of the forest village as per FRA.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Sept. 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )2.Identification of sites and cluster formation:The Gram Sabha (GS) will be interacting with the interested farmers in the village and will form the cluster with 20 to 25 farmers.. Then the cluster will decide in presence of GS about their strategy planning, budget, sharing of profit etc. The GS will be playing an instrumental role in identifying the sites of farming as well. 10 sites of 5 hectares each will be identified to start with in year 1. This site selection involves meetings and having agreement with the land owners for private land and passing resolution in GS meetings - this process will be done by GS.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Oct. 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )         3. Central workshop with community leaders:The central level conceptual workshop will be organised with some of the leading farmers in the clusters along with the selected members of Gram Sabha (GS) and a few members from the monitoring team so that the entire concept of this livelihood initiative can be imparted in the community. This workshop will be based on the idea of agroecological farming which includes different techniques of soil and water management, intercropping, mix cropping, promotion and cultivation of indigenous varieties and so on. There will be 1 central level workshop every year.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - July 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )        4. Follow up workshop on ground:The follow up workshop will be organised with the farmers at the ground level. This will be more of a hand holding training with the farmers where way by using all those methods and concepts learned from the agroecological workshops.3. This farming practice will start with 250 farmers in 10 villages. Each year at least 100 new farmers will be added to the cluster. The total cultivable area will also be increased each year depending on the availability of adjacent land. It is expected that the farmers annual income from the farming sector will be increased at least by 40% at the end of 3 years. 4. This livelihood initiative will help convert 50 hectare of unused fallow land into productive land by 3 years along with its plantation work with 1,00,000 sapling  for the regeneration of forest.Grant Application Form, July 1 201311different methods and techniques of agroecological farming will be learned. There will be 2 follow up workshops every year in different geographical locations.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - May 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )        5. Farming:In year 1 a total 250 farmers will be involved in the farming activity in 10 selected sites of total 50 hectare land. Farmers will be selecting their seasonal crops for farming. There will be 4 different sites of vermicomposting to supply enough organic manure to all 10 sites.  Mainly the local varieties of vegetables along with a few oil seeds will be grown in 2 seasons each year.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Dec 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )          6. Plantation:Conservation of forest has been one of the primary ideas of this livelihood initiative. 4 sites will be identified for raising nurseries of around 10,000 saplings which would take 3 months - from January 2021 to March 2021. The plantation work will start from April 2021. Different wood varieties that are found naturally in the forest area (native variety) will be selected for plantation along with a few teak plantations in the fringe.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - April 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )          7. Marketing linkages and selling of produce:Marketing linkages will be established in the local areas and in the nearest town for the organically produced vegetables.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - April-May 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):To develop a new rung of leadership from the youth (12 to 18 years) through an education that is rooted in their socio-cultural-ecological context and empowers them to develop self-reliance and live in their culture with dignity.7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1. We envisage to have a group of youth leaders in the targeted 6 villages. At the end of 3 years the youth group in the village will have comprehensive knowledge about FRA. This group will be instrumental in mobilizing the forest dwelling community in accessing their rights vested in FRA. Members of this group will be participating in regular Gram Sabhas meetings.2. It is expected that all the learners of the 6 centers will become aware of the historical socio-economic and the political context of the forest villagers. The learners will also become aware of the ecological context as to how they are living in harmony with the forest. They will participate in the community Grant Application Form, July 1 2013127.3.c. Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Activites:1.Workshop to develop learning modules:Develop a model of education that focuses on the social, economic and environmental needs of local forest dwelling communities - addressing issues such as responding to climate change, conservation of forests, supporting existing sustainable livelihood practices,reducing migration and maintaining inter-community harmony. This will be done by members of solidarity groups, community facilitators and the Gram Sabha members who will be involved in running the 6 learning centres.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Feb-March 2021 / Y2 - No / Y3 - No )2.Follow up review workshop:The Follow up workshop will be essentially organised for reviewing the learning modules, discussion on the pedagogy and also developing strategy planning for running the learning centres.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - June 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )       3. Selection of 6 sites for learning centres:Start learning centers and community schools in six areas (four in Alipurduar-Jalpaiguri and two in the hills of Darjeeling and Kalimpong) for the youth to be conversant in the developed modules while also providing tutoring support to dropout students and those struggling in their mainstream curriculum.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Sept-Dec 2020 / Y2 - No / Y3 - No )        4. Organize an inter-community cultural festival and school-level competitions annually:The festivals and cultural events will help create a space for better relationships between the communities. Given the multi ethnicity of the community this type of inter-community festival helps build cohesion in the group which enables them to work together in the conservation practice, protecting their forest, claiming their constitutional rights and also accessing the livelihood opportunities.Timeframe:  ( Y1 - Throughout the year / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )forest conservation efforts.3. This learning process will empower them with the capacity to interface with the forest department and the government in terms of accessing their constitutional rights and entitlements as a forest dwelling community.4.  The festivals and cultural events will create a space for better relationships between the communities. This will be understood and measured by collecting anecdotal evidence.Grant Application Form, July 1 201313",
        "8. COOPERATION": "8. CooperationDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks and explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 words):The tropical forests of sub-Himalayan Bengal in India contain rich biodiversity and anthropogenic wealth. Several indigenous communities, such as Rava, Mech, Dukpa, Garo and many Jharkhandi adivasi groups (Oraon, Kheria, Santhal, Munda, Baraik) live here. Lepcha, Limbu, Rai, Tamang, Sherpa and other ethnic groups now being generically termed as Gorkha  also live here. Many of these people were brought in from surrounding states and forced to stay in the ghettoized settlements of forest villages set up by British foresters as labor colonies in the late 19th and early 20th Century.Colonial laws passed by the British Government made it unlawful for forest tribes to even live within the forest or source their daily needs. The British also converted forest land to monoculture commercial timber plantations destroying the forest ecosystem in the process.After Independence the Indian Government too, created policies with similar goals. Even laws passed ostensibly for conservation targeted forest communities as destructive to the environment and evicted them. Illegal timber harvesting continued and contributed to heavy deforestation, often also victimizing forest communities. Today, the timber industry takes advantage of poverty among these communities and employs them to harvest timber from the forest thus adding to ongoing environmental degradation.The Forest Rights Act (FRA), passed in 2006, gave joint ownership of forest areas to both the Government and indigenous forest-based communities. It empowered these communities to form governing institutions that would administer the forest together with the Forest Department. Currently, it suffers from inadequate implementation due to lack of awareness among the affected communities.The main actors involved in the larger context of the work are the peoples social movement, an NGO, the forest communities and solidarity groups. Another stakeholder is the Forest Department.People from the community are involved in every step of the process from site selection to forming the groups to participate in agriculture. The learning centers on the other hand will be open to all youth of 12-18 years in the community. Gram Sabhas will be the main agency involved in the filing of the CFR as well as mapping the community forest areas.",

EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):A monitoring team will be formed for each project site, consisting of community leaders and project coordinators. This team will meet the communities each month and hold review meetings every 2 months. Gram Sabhas will also be monitoring the work at their respective sites. At the inter site level, the existing secretariat of the group will do the monitoring on a monthly basisAdditionally, for the learning centers, the monitoring and evaluation team will include civil society members and solidarity groups who will support in developing the learning modules. There would be 2 evaluations in a year for the learning centers. The first year would be focussed on understanding the efficacy and acceptance of the learning modules. The feedback will be used for modifications and adjustments.AID volunteers will also carry out an annual evaluation by being on site as they have for the past 5 years.The evaluation questions for the livelihood part would be to see how the community is bonding and making decisions, if they have been able to operationalize and start agriculture and how many times they are meeting and interacting with their respective Gram Sabhas.For the learning centers, the regularity of the centers and the attendance in them would indicate the acceptance of the learning modules. Further on in the program, interactions with the youth will give an idea about their understanding of the local environment and care for it. Beyond that, it would be important to eventually see the youth participating in the Gram Sabha meetings and playing an active role in it.For the Forest Rights component, we will need to see how many resource maps are developed for the community forests, followed by how many CFRs are filed. Finally, it would be important to see if the community is using the community forest land in a way that is beneficial to them.To understand the impact, we would look at the following:Number of people participating in agriculture, learning at each siteChange in the production of vegetables over the years at each siteObserving the increase/decrease in the participation of women and out migrantsChange in the mortality rate of the plantationsForest area mapped and the number of Community Forest Rights applicationNumber of learners in each centerGrant Application Form, July 1 201315",

Summarise the projects ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)The MRC (Migrants Resilience Collaborative) is Indias largest grassroots-led initiative steered by our Indian organisation partner, Jan Sahas. Initially, the program has a period of three years and will span over 100 districts, of which 15-20 have high apparel-based migration, to sustainably impact 10 million migrants over five years. We aim to enable systemic improvements that build socio-economic resilience for over 139 million migrants.The MRC has a strong affinity with Oaks commitment to address global, social and environmental issues, particularly among the disadvantaged. The MRC enables the Oak Foundation to advance these goals both systemically and at scale, whilst leveraging the commitment of large institutional funders such as Omidyar Network, Dell Foundation, H.T. Parekh Foundation, and Godrej Group, at a time of heightened need.More than 95% of migrants that we support belong to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other backward classes. We aim to address the inequalities within these communities.In addition, several components of MRCs strategy and approach are aligned, including but not limited to:  1) Building agency of migrant families and safeguarding labour rights.2) Working with migrants specifically engaged in the construction and textiles sector.3) Working with industry including the textiles industry to build an inclusive economy.4) Focusing on systemic improvements.",

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Jan Sahas has been working with the most excluded communities for over two decades, providing support on issues such as prevention and response to gender-based violence, forced labour, and caste-based manual scavenging. This includes: 1) Uniquely blending our grassroots-led approach with a focus on scale, facilitating direct support in ~60 districts across nine states of India, serving~2,000,000 women and girls across program areas, tracking >200,000 migrant workers, rescuing >4.2k bonded and child labourers, and delivering >128,000 entitlements to migrants. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jan Sahas worked with 42 non-profits across 19 states in India to address needs of >1 million migrant families through immediate relief support. There have been a few projects that have been instrumental in achieving this. These include: an Initiative to substantially reduce the practice of Forced and Child Labour (F&CL) in cotton production in Madhya Pradesh, India; Fighting Forced Labour with Adivasi and Dalit communities in South Asia; Nirmaan Mazdoor Sashaktikaran Karyakram (NMSK) and Bandhuaa Majdoor Mukti Abhiyan.2) With support from CBOs (Community Based Organisations), Jan Sahas has influenced key legislation (The Landmark Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013), and participates on various government working commissions (for example, Government of Madhya Pradeshs commission on migrant workers, NITI Aayogs Working Group for Social Justice and Empowerment to support on migration).  Jan Sahas promoted CBO, Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan and has influenced several initiatives at departmental and state level on the issue of manual scavenging and gender justice. Jan Sahas aims to address the issues faced specifically by migrant families at an unprecedented scale and crucially it has quickly emerged into new geographical areas. Thus, Jan Sahas believes in a collaborative approach, partnering with CBOs with similar values across the country to facilitate direct support through its interventions. 6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Our priority is to adopt a learning-based organic scale-up approach that focuses on quality and continues to ensure strong accountability to our communities. Based on our learnings from our projects in the space of migration, we have developed a detailed scale up model. Since October 2020, we have started working using our current operating model on the theme in 50 districts and supporting 40 additional civil society organizations to intervene in another 50 districts. We are also piloting innovations to work at greater scale and update our operating models over the next five years. The key to our success will be a unified technology system: a unified database of 10 million workers along with their information based on which of the three services (social security, responsible recruitment, and worker protection) they opt Grant Application Form, July 1 20138for. Our Jan Saathi social security entitlements application and national labour helpline will be at the top of our database. We are currently developing this technology system and intend to integrate these with government systems to radically simplify the delivery of benefits to workers.To achieve all of this, we have made our investments in technology, a second line of leadership, and strengthening internal systems give us confidence that we can build capacities that complement our strengths in grassroots reach, experience of large-scale programs, and commitment to excluded communities to anchor this initiative.6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):There are an estimated 139 million internal migrant workers in India. Despite being large contributors to Indias GDP, migrant workers face systematic disenfranchisement due to power imbalance & high vulnerability. As a result, they face three principal challenges: Non-recognition by states, & lack of social security leading to debt and poverty.Under the proposed project we intend to use the corridor approach (work at source & destination together). The proposed geographic focus is the West Bengal migration corridor. We have selected 4 high prevalence districts of migration in West Bengal (Murshidabad, Nadia, Bardhaman and Birbhum) as source districts & Mumbai-Suburban and Delhi-NCR region as destination areas.According to Census 2011, West Bengal ranks fourth among states from where people migrate to for work and employment. Approximately 80% of work-migrants from the state migrate to Maharashtra (45.3%) and Delhi-NCT (34%). Research shows that much of the migrant population in the country belong to lower-income quintile groups and are likely to be deprived of social security. In 2004-05, approximately 35% of workers in rural West Bengal were out of social security coverage and this increased to 50% in 2011-12. Furthermore, according to a study on the access to flagship programme benefits and public services in West Bengal, it was found that access to benefits was critically low due to lack of awareness, procedural complexities, harassment, apathy of state officials and opportunity cost being higher than benefit. The access to benefits is critically limited due to a lack of awareness, delay, procedural complexities, harassment, insensitivity of implementing officials and elected representatives, adverse selection & opportunity cost being higher than benefit. Given the high rates of poverty, out-migration and poor access to entitlement, it is critical that concerted efforts are placed into improving the social security coverage in West Bengal.We decided that launching the MRC now would have the most impact for the following reasons:Unprecedented political will and demand for Jan Sahas support on migrants issue: Post-COVID, migrant welfare has become a major political issue:1) Central and State governments have embarked on social security registration drives, several have set up migrant welfare commissions. The central government accepted $1 billion credit fund from the World Bank to create a social registry for Grant Application Form, July 1 20139strengthening social security.2) Jan Sahas has partnered with multiple governments (for example, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana) and we are discussing partnerships with several others. Partnering with West Bengal and Maharashtra has been considered in the project plan.Unprecedented industry willingness to support migrants, including Jan Sahass mission: Industry bodies such as CREDAI and FICCI have taken up the cause of social security as a trust-building measure and to improve the value proposition for workers. Four of the largest Indian construction companies (L&T, Godrej, Lodha, Mahindra & Mahindra) co-signed an open letter with Jan Sahas, advocating for governments to deliver on its policies including benefits for migrant workers and committing to partner with government and civil society.Demonstrated interest from philanthropy and civil society to support migrant workers: Large funders such as Omidyar Network, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, HT Parekh Foundation have recalibrated strategies to support migrant families. With both need and the potential for high impact, the MRC seeks to harness the opportunity to capitalize on opportunity and address systemic at scale. In the 6 months of operations MRC has registered 1,036,626 migrant households of which 424,400 were women led, filled 1,192,936 social security applications, ensured benefits received to 847,556 migrant individuals. While, the helpline received 2871 and 753 cases were registered through different sources (helpline and field). We are fully cognisant of the threats facing the program and have established a plan to address them:1) Current and future FCRA law amendments hinder sub-granting funds to partner CBOs.2) Reduced bargaining power of migrants and the industrys willingness to support reforms due to added vulnerability of migrants. Additionally, the impact of the pandemic has sparked a change in labour codes.",
        "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. Objectives (maximum 2,200 words)For a core support grant, state the purpose of this grant request and complete the objectives.  After consultations with an Oak PO, you may decide to summarise your mission as one broad objective. In this case, it is still necessary to specify activities and results/outcomes for this objective.For project support grants please list your objectives for this project in bullet point format. (You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. Under each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to achieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):Strengthening social security delivery system and increasing access to benefits and entitlements.Grant Application Form, July 1 2013107.1.c. Objective 1 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1. Facilitating social security through community-based volunteers, leveraging partnerships with government and industry: key barriers for workers include a lack of awareness, and a complex government system that is challenging to navigate, and a complete lack of a proactive delivery system. MRC has built a tech platform as a solution to profile (general information like name, residence, mobile, and intervention-specific information) and track migrants. All individuals supported across interventions and location are profiled at the first touch point, with subsequent engagements logged on, enabling MRC to track workers, their progress, enable simplified access to other services, while enabling MRC to understand most effective sales channels. The platform will be built to enable interoperability across government and other civil society systems to the extent possible, enabling sharing of information. In the long-term, this could substitute or supplement governments own data registrieTo overcome the barriers, we intend to train (on this tech platform) and leverage 59 Jan Saathis and block-level field workers, many of whom are from high-migration and historically excluded communities. In each district, we aim to build awareness, onboard workers onto our tech platform, conduct on-the-spot eligibility checks and provide support in accessing key social security benefits (e.g., land rights, insurance, education, and other key benefits). The Jan Saathis will register these workers on the platform and update progress after check in calls or follow up meetings. Jan Saathis/field workers will also train and draw support from village-based barefoot lawyers from the community, who will be trained to build awareness within their villages regarding entitlements and basic rights. With state and industry buy-in through MoUs, Jan Saathis / field workers will help to drive social security registrations at scale. 2. Innovations to improve efficiency and sustainability of social security delivery systems: Apart from the Jan Saathi model and continuous improvements therein, the MRC aims to design and implement interventions that enable the delivery of social security faster, better and more cost-efficiently. They will be measured and tracked through the MRC tech platform in pilot areas, prior to scaling. Potential and planned interventions include:Leveraging business correspondents for social security delivery. This is an ongoing activity.( Business Correspondents are deployed by banks to deliver basic banking services outside the bank branch. Migrant workers use their services to send and receive remittances and carry out other basic:a. Banking transactions. We believe the relationship will be mutually beneficial as the BCs will not only get an opportunity to earn additional revenue through provision of complimentary services (migrant registration and social security 7.1.b. Objective 1 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1) 4,00,000 workers and their families registered for, and aware of the key social security schemes in 3 years.2) 2,40,000 workers receiving key benefits in 3 yearsGrant Application Form, July 1 201311delivery) but also help to increase cross-sell opportunities).b. Integrating our social security technology with government systems through interoperable Application Programming Interfaces or integrating with Common Service Centres by leveraging MoUs for social security delivery with the state government. 7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):Enabling responsible recruitment. (this is consistent with the wording of Objective 1)7.2.c. Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1. Advocate for responsible recruitment within industry, in partnership with financiers, brands and industry associations. We intend to partner and advocate with companies (both of construction and textiles), focusing on the largest companies to strengthen worker support. In particular, we intend to leverage financiers (e.g., HDFC Bank), brands (e.g., C&A, H&M, Arvind Mills), and industry bodies (e.g., CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM, CREDAI), to strengthen their norms and expectations from members, and drive downstream improvements across their membership and supply chains. We will also advocate for adherence of norms that disproportionately affect women (e.g., implementation of POSH Act, equal wages for equal work, better sanitation facilities, and fair growth opportunities);2. Co-creating mechanisms for developing implementable solutions for responsible recruitment. We aim to engage with the financiers /investors, brands, industry association and companies to identify key priorities, opportunities, and gaps in the sector and within the value chain.  Ultimately, we would co-create a pathway for developing some of the solutions for building responsible recruitment practices within the company and its supply chain. The solutions may differ depending on the size and scale of the company and the region or geographies they operate in. Such partnerships and adoption by large companies in construction and textiles will strengthen worker welfare; likely improve worker retention at a time when companies are facing labour shortages and play a signalling role for other companies in the sector too. Our objective through such engagement is for industry to own such initiatives, including publicly owning its success.3. New model for placement support by leveraging government portal. We have partnered with the Quality Council of India to pilot the UNNATI portal, which aims to connect 200 million workers with job providers. Aside from leveraging this 7.2.b. Objective 2 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words): 1,00,000 workers responsibly recruited in 3 years by 15+ companies and industry associations.Grant Application Form, July 1 201312to influence government planning, we will use our learnings from this in year 2 to design a model that encompasses our database of migrant workers and the labour demand from large companies to support employment opportunities for migrant workers (e.g., in partnership with existing recruitment agents). 7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):Enabling protection. (consistent with Objectives 1 & 2)7.3.c. Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):1.  National, 24X7 migrant multi-lingual labour helpline: Our toll-free helpline will provide information to workers on their rights and entitlements and register complaints regarding forced labour. It will facilitate rescue support, where required in coordination with district authorities. Registering the worker on our tech platform also enables the MRC to reconnect with the worker over an outgoing call and provide information that allows them to connect to resource centres and Jan Saathis. 30% of the Jan Saathis and helpline staff will be women to ensure female workers and family members are comfortable to reach out to them and can better enable reach.2.  Remedial and legal support through lawyers initiative forum: the MRC will facilitate dispatch support for cases received over the helpline or through other touch points. This includes:a.  field workers in districts coordinating with local authorities to support/rescue workers in forced labour situations; in recent cases in Madhya Pradesh, MRC staff have advised local authorities, enabling them to deliver rescue efforts independently.   b.  legal aid through the Lawyers Initiative Forum (a Jan Sahas promoted, pro-bono forum of +1,400 lawyers), or part-time lawyers hired in each district.For dispatch services our approach has been to collaborate strategically with other civil society initiatives such as those by ILO, UNDP and Aajeevika Bureau and other prominent Civil society Organisations in order to drive systemic changes. In order to avoid delicacy of efforts we will transfer cases to network organisations with capacity and presence in the geography.Over the next 3-5 years, our goal is to establish the helpline and the field worker dispatch support as a standalone public good, adopted by Government, akin to ChildLine.7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):We aim to reduce forced labour by 60% (in the districts of project operation) by making worker protection support available to workers.Grant Application Form, July 1 2013133.  Agency and awareness building for self-protection: a.  At source, the MRC will scale Jan Sahass barefoot lawyer volunteer program which trains motivated, local youths to build awareness and agency in their own villages.b.  Prior to migration, each worker under the project will be trained at source on rights and entitlements at the destination, remedies available, best practices for them to adopt, and a pocket-sized handbook to keep their own record of work and financial transactions, along with key information such as the National helpline number.c.  At destination, field workers will engage migrants on rights, socialize MRC offerings and provide other critical support to them, including anything identified through the handbook. We will set up District migration resource centres, these district level units will facilitate personalized information services, advice and trainings for migrants and their families on availing benefits, legal rights, industry norms, and protective measures available. The resource centre will also act as a hub for worker protection outreach and dispatch services.4.  Research for worker protection:Evidence-based knowledge on sexual violence against female migrant workers across the textile and construction value chain, to enable informed strategy/intervention design and policy advocacy towards prevention of sexual violence. The study will identify the factors that enable sexual violence and amplify the experiences of female migrant workers including the root causes for non-reporting of such cases formally.",
        "8. COOPERATION": "8. CooperationDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks and explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 words):The MRC unites organisations and networks who will support the execution of the program. These organisations can be further categorized as Implementation Partners and Strategic Partners.Implementation Partners: these are organisations that complement Jan Sahass geographic reach and ability to provide direct support to migrant communities: We have currently partnered with 16 CBOs across 19 districts with a goal to work with ~40-45 CBOs across 40-45 districts. Jan Sahas held workshops and discussions with long-term partner CBOs (e.g., Yuva Vikas Mandal, Gramin Swavalamban Samiti, Progressive Society) to validate priorities and develop the MRC strategy. Leaders of long-term partner CBOs routinely join Jan Sahass internal workshops and meetings.Strategic partners: organisations which complement Jan Sahass strengths at the Project Monitoring Unit, include:Grant Application Form, July 1 2013141) Global Development Incubator (GDI): who helped co-create the concept of the MRC. Their expertise lies in building collaboratives and multi-stakeholder initiatives globally, including providing support on design and strategy. GDI has incubated or closely supported~40 multi-stakeholder initiatives, including the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, Refugee Investment Network, Partnership for Economic Inclusion, and Co-impact. GDIs mandate is to co-develop and support operationalisation of the MRCs systems change strategy and pilots and provide support on governance and fundraising. 2) EdelGive Foundation: who bring expertise in anchoring cross-sectoral partnerships across the social, corporate, and government sectors. They have anchored collaborations such as The Collaborators for Transforming Education and The Coalition for Women Empowerment, and regularly facilitate cross-industry conversations on key social impact issues. Their mandate is to support partnerships, private sector engagement, fundraising, and governance. 3) Societal Platform: who bring expertise in developing public-good technology platforms for social causes. They have closely supported building technology platforms for Digital Green, Arghyam, and EkStep Foundation. Their mandate is to support the MRC in strengthening program structures and design using technology.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. ImpactWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum 300 words):The change we wish to achieve from this project is reflected in our Vision and Goals:Vision: The MRCs vision is to end exploitative practices and dramatically reduce socio-economic vulnerability of migrant families across India.Strategic Goal 1: Social Security: strengthening inclusive social protection system and increasing access to benefits and entitlements for 2,40,000 migrant families and workers over 3 years.Implementation4,00,000 workers and their families registered for and are aware of the key social security schemes.2,40,000 receiving key benefits in 3 yearsSystems/advocacyDemonstrate a scalable, low-cost delivery model for governments to adopt. This would include stronger operations (e.g., reduced time for delivery, improved coverage, simpler registration) of key govt. agencies involved in delivery.Portability of key benefits across states.Establish clear ROI for large employers in terms of reduced cost of worker acquisition / retention through research. Grant Application Form, July 1 201315Strategic Goal 2: Responsible Recruitment: enabling responsible recruitment to improve living & working conditions of 1,00,000 workers over 3 years.Implementation1,00,000 responsibly recruited in 3 years by 15+ companies and industry associations.Systems/advocacyStronger compliance with key labour laws/norms (e.g., wages, living and working conditions) by 15+ large companies around worker welfare at sites and along the supply chain; setting an example for the rest of the industry. Strategic Goal 3: Worker Protection: building migrant workers agency, strengthening worker protection mechanisms and providing support to individuals suffering from labour and sexual exploitation to receive remedial and legal support, reducing forced labour by 60% in the region of project implementation in over 3 years.ImplementationWorker protection support available to 80% cases received on helpline and other modes of trackingSystems/advocacyEstablish a national migrant worker helpline that can be government/PPP-adopted.Improve state and central policies on safeguarding rights of workers, including textiles and construction specific policies10. EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):The process monitoring flow will consist of the following steps: 1.  Data entry / collection and analysis: Field Officers, MIS coordinators will collect and enter data. Monthly, Quarterly, Annual and SWAT Reports will be generated with data and field visit insights, led by MEL Manager. Reports will include recommendations on further research, rapid assessments, training needs and adaptation of strategy, led by the MEL Manager.2.  Report Dissemination & learnings: MEL team will share monthly and annually with management; district team leads and partner CBOs. Monthly and annual meetings will take place to share learnings, understand challenges and troubleshoot. Training will be carried out with specific teams, when required and annual refresher training will be provided when necessary. 3.  Senior Management Team (SMT) meetings: based on MEL and team meetings feedback, SMT will discuss major roadblocks, challenges, progress-check, and Grant Application Form, July 1 201316share success stories and learnings, and re-align on the way forward. The SMT will then formulate rapid assessments, research and advocacy plans. Process/ Implementation Evaluation: leveraging internal strengths of technology-based tools and real-time dashboards, we will undertake self-evaluations towards improvement of our delivery model and tracking system. As described in the MEL framework, progress on KPIs and activities will be monitored monthly and annually, and further SWAT teams will be formed to address bottlenecks such as conversion time of entitlements and drive fast fails.In the past, such process evaluations have helped to improve program performance, implementation rhythm and in mid-term corrective action in a phased manner  that is, learnings from one phase helping in next phase activities. We strongly believe this adaptability in program strategies and ground operations has been the key in the success of our interventions with highly dynamic communities such as migrants. The systemic changes will be evaluated based on comparative analysis of the government database / reports with our Social registry and analytics and third-party evaluations to map relevance, effectiveness, efficacy, impact and sustainability, in reducing exploitation and socio-economic vulnerability of migrant families and facilitation of safe migration.",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future PlansHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum 300 words):The MRC has brought together components to contribute to nation-wide system changes.  The MRC envisions a deep level of engagement with all key stakeholders  communities, industry and government, enabling depth of experience and learnings. We believe that assets (e.g., industry assessment tools, research products), learnings (e.g., from pilots and scaling of interventions), and networks (e.g., of companies partnering with the MRC, some of whom will have global Grant Application Form, July 1 201317presence) developed through the course of the project by the MRC and its partners have significant potential for sharing, translation, & potentially replication to other geographies.Currently, from Oak Foundation we are seeking a contribution for interventions in the West Bengal, Mumbai and Delhi Corridor for over 3 years. This contribution would make Oak Foundation one of the joint largest funders of the MRC. The MRC considers the Oak Foundation as a key funder due to its specific commitment towards migrant communities and driving systems change in the sector. As the duration of the MRC is over 5 years, we intend to allocate the remaining funding from funds already raised from donors like Omidyar Network and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation (MSDF) and additional fundraising. Beyond 5 years, our target for sustainability and scale is adoption by the government boards (such as BOCW) and the private sector. Thus, moving away from the need for further philanthropic funding and towards 80% adoption by the private companies. We believe that large companies will see financial and reputational benefits of facilitating social security entitlements for their workers and will be willing to cover the costs of delivery. As a part of the consortium, we have multiple donors (MSDF, Godrej, Omidyar Network, H.T. Parekh Foundation) who will support us as our strategic partners, and alongside them we hope to have Oak Foundation represented on the strategic Board.",

(300 words)CPF was established in the backdrop of realising the goal of forest dependent communities in the management of forest resources as per the National Forest Policy 1988. CPF got registered in August 2002. The organisation has mandated to work on other natural resources as part of the landscapes and ecosystems in which forests are a part.CPF worked with Government and civil society organization in promoting the Joint Forest Management, and later the Community Forest Management Oak Application Form     6programs. It worked with 680 Vanasamrakshana Samithis in 32 Forest Ranges with 32 NGO partners. They were spread over 12 districts in the three regions of undivided Andhra Pradesh, representing 80,800 households and protecting over 1,00,000 (one lakh) hectares of forest.CPF understood that forest-based livelihoods alone not sufficient for enhancing the incomes and conserving the natural resources. It was also realized that tribal communities were unable to access basic services and social security schemes because of remoteness and apathy of officials. This led CPF to work with communities and government on entitlements and sustainable NRM based livelihoods through community-based institutions.Key AchievementsI.      Agro-Ecologcial Practices and Water resource development4065 farmers following agroecological practices in an extent of 3000 acresPromotion of horticulture plantations among 500 farmers in 500 acres16569 acres of land was treated with land under cultivation increasing by 11% and ground water availability by 66%II.     Access to Entitlements5711 individuals accessed social security schemes, 6640 availed Crop loans, farm machineries, and subsidies and 8357 Job card holders received workINR 5.44 crores leveraged in 72 habitations for community-based infrastructure development in past six years (2015-21)III.    Facilitation of securing Forest Rights9460 IFR titles received for 20045 acres covering 535 villages 1350 CFR claims submitted and 183 CFR management plans prepared by Gramasabhas5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Alienation of tribals from the forest has dwindled their livelihoods, food security and increased poverty. It reduced their involvement in sustainable forest management and harvesting practices of NTFP.  This led to adverse impact on conservation of forest eco-system. Lack of awareness and skills to have constructive and collaborative engagement with government reduced access to avail rights and entitlements.Over two decades, CPF worked with indigenous and other resource poor communities in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. The organization facilitated the communities to access rights on forest resources and supported Oak Application Form     7them in sustainable natural resource management through promoting community institutions. This enabled them to reap the collective advantages of sustainable extraction and value addition of NTFP, participatory natural resource management and access entitlements from government.CPF undertakes works that aligns with its vision. Before planning any intervention, action research is undertaken to analyze and identify the change and roles to be played by CPF and other stakeholders. The intervention is planned in a collaborative approach with defined objectives and outcomes involving community in planning, implementing and monitoring, enabling them towards sustainability.CPF strategically works with government to build rapport between communities and concerned departments for leveraging funds for community needs. It appraises them about its work for possible replication.CPF strives to ensure equity and equality in its functioning with women playing equal role in all its interventions. It facilitates in building their capacities, gain access and ownership over resources and become decision-makers.A scoping study was conducted in West Bengal, while interacting with relevant stakeholders to comprehend the prevailing policies, programs and their implementation in proposed project locations.Based on the observations from the scoping study, CPF proposes to work in Ranibandh block, Bankura district of West Bengal because of its dense forest and high tribal population (Savara-PVTG, Santhal, Munda, Singh Sardar etc) with 47.1 % (Census, 2011). The main source of livelihood is agriculture, livestock and NTFP and majority are small and marginal farmers depending on rain fed agriculture. Though the district receives around 1400 mm rainfall, yet cultivation of crop primarily depends on constricted period of erratic rainfall. Due to lack of proper water harvesting structures, water percolation to the ground is minimal and irrigation facility is low. The farmers are predominantly into mono crop cultivation i.e., paddy. The farming practices are inorganic leading to high input cost and negative environmental impacts.The Sundarban estuary with mangrove forest is inhabited by the resource poor and vulnerable communities. Owing to historical reasons coupled with climatic extremities and natural calamities, it remains one of the extremely underdeveloped places with 34 % below poverty line. Livelihood depends on agriculture (24.37%), un-organized labour (36.35%), house hold industries (4.86%) and others (34.42%) including fishery, forest resource collection [1]. The inhabitants of the region are also extremely vulnerable in various physical and socio-economic indicators.In Sunderban, CPF propose to work on enhancing access of entitlements to communities in Sandeshkhali-I Block of North 24 Parganas District due to the high social vulnerability of the region with 25.95% of the population belonging to ST and 30.90% belonging to SC communities.CPF vision and past experience of working with tribal and resource poor communities and Oak foundations focus areas to support the indigenous communities in West Bengal will bring in synergy in advancing the rights, availing entitlements and livelihood development in the proposed area of intervention.Oak Application Form     8Oak Foundation funding will be used for facilitating the communities to adopt crop diversification through improved agriculture practices, enhance livelihoods and enable the communities to access their rights and entitlements.[1] Census, 2011, West Bengal State Climate Action Plan, 2021",

        "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. OBJECTIVESThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain what you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We understand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a multitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define your role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss this with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   7.a. ObjectivesList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals that can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are ambitious but also achievable.  Overall objective / GoalImproving livelihoods of tribals, resource poor and other vulnerable communities through promoting sustainable natural resource management and enhancing access to entitlements by building linkages with the Government institutions in 25 forest fringe villages of Ranibandh block of Bankura district and 12 villages in Sandeshkhali-I block of North 24 Parganas.Specific Objectives1. Formation and strengthening the village level institutions/groups while ensuring women leadership in these institutions2. Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water resource development for food & nutritional security amongst male and female farmers3. Enhancing access to alternative livelihoods among landless, resource poor and other forest dependent communities while keeping with special emphasis on women farmers4. Enabling project communities to access and avail their constitutional rights and entitlementsBackground and ContextGiven the experience of working in watershed project locations, CPF propose to work in the watershed areas in Randibandh block of Bankura district Oak Application Form     9covering 25 villages of Ranibandh, Barikul and Rautora Gram Panchayats. The Integrated Watershed Management Programme, West Bengal was implemented in the proposed project locations in the year 2011-12 covering a total geographical area of 8819 ha of which the total treatable area was 5398 ha. It was observed that the benefits of creation of these watershed structures could not be sustain due to lack of emphasis on improved agriculture practices, creation and strengthening of farmers institutions and bringing in convergence of various government schemes for the benefit of tribal and other resource poor households.The present project aims to address the above-mentioned gaps. And it would demonstrate how the watershed projects in the forest fringe villages could be taken to the next level to reap the benefits and also sustain the initiatives through community participation.The Sundarban estuary with mangrove forest is inhabited by the resource poor and vulnerable communities, owing to historical reasons coupled with climatic extremities and natural calamities. The inhabitants of the region are also extremely vulnerable in various physical and socio-economic indicators including infrastructure, food security, healthcare, education, drinking water and sanitation. It was observed that, livelihoods based on natural resources alone will not effectively sustain the people of the region. CPF proposes to work on enhancing access to entitlements for communities covering 12 villages of Boyermari-I, Boyermani-II and Hatgachi Gram Panchayats of Sandeshkhali-I Block of North 24 Parganas District.Thus, the project has immense potential for scaling up and replication in other socio-economically vulnerable regions of West Bengal.CPFs RoleThe organization works with community institutions and capacitates them in appropriate skills as well as federates them at different levels for reaping collective advantages with regard to accessing their rights on forest resources and supports them in sustainable natural resource management including forest resources. Sustainable extraction of Non timber forest produce, value addition at the community level, participatory resource monitoring, water resource development, facilitating agro ecological practices in their lands, and helping them to access entitlements and proper services from the government departments are some of the activities the organization undertakes, to address the problems of the communities.While recognizing that women lack decision making and negotiation skills, mobility, identity and self -esteem and access to and control over resources and assets, CPF focuses on building their leadership through all its interventions.Primary stakeholders are the tribal and resource poor communities who mostly belong to the small and marginal farmer categorySecondary stakeholders are the various government departments, traders and other service providers (who are engaged to provide certain services to the community).1. Formation and strengthening the village level institutions/groupsa. Formation and strengthening of Tribal Farmers Service Centre (TFSC)Oak Application Form     10The Tribal Farmers Service Centres will be formed with two representatives from each small group as committee members. CPF ensures that 50 percent are women in these committees with leadership role in the committee. The centers are managed by the committee and they provide services viz., Knowledge services, information about government schemes, providing agricultural implements on minimum rental basis. The amount collected will be used to sustain the Centre. Major Implements will be purchased with minor contribution from the project farmers.b. Formation and strengthening of Village Coordination Groups (VCGs)CPF initiated a concept called Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) during the year 2016. In the VCGs, two members from each of the existing CBOs (one female and one male) are grouped at the habitation level along with Sarpanch and one ward member. The purpose is to facilitate to access entitlements to all eligible individuals and also seek support for community needs. Awareness regarding various new government schemes, policies for tribals including Forest Rights Act also discussed in the VCGs. VCG meets once in a month and discusses about the follow-up to be done with regard to the access/petitions submitted. It not only supports the individual CBOs on issues identified but also discusses about the community level issues and requirements such as  repair to PHC centre, approach road, drinking water etc.At each of the 37 project habitations VCGs will be formed. Women representatives from CBOs will become leaders in the VCGs formed. Thus, VCG will contribute in filling the gap between the communities, Panchayats and block officials.The VCGs provide services to all eligible households (as per baseline) access different government schemes of West Bengal like Khadya Saathi Scheme (RKSY-1 & 2), Duara Sarkar (campaign on 18 schemes with delivery at door step) etc., and Community level entitlements.Activities1. Formation of 25 Tribal Farmer Service Centre (TFSC) and 37 Village Coordination Groups2.

        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):Participation and collaboration is central to the way CPF functions. CPF follows a constructive, critical and collaborative approach with Communities and CSOs for implementing all its activities and projects. Depending on the nature of intervention, CPF had sought / worked with experts, academic institutions and networks. This has helped in not only realising project goals but also established CPF as a transparent organisation.In West Bengal, CPF had already began its interactions with relevant stakeholders including government as it is paramount in the smooth grounding of project interventions. Through the scoping study, Pradan which is working in the Bankura district is identified as a possible collaborator for livelihood interventions and discussions were held with their team in this regard. Besides this, other CSO representatives were consulted extensively to understand the relevant issues and the proposal was vetted seeking their inputs. Consultations with various stakeholders will be continued.One of the major stakeholders in implementation of the project are the local governing bodies including the gram panchayats. The project envisions to engage gram panchayats at various levels of the project especially in providing access to rights and entitlements to the project communities. The various government departments especially the agriculture department, panchayat and rural development department will be engaged in leveraging the government schemes and programs that aligns with the project objectives. The project will engage with organisations providing research and extension-based services such as Krishi Vignana Kendra (KVK). Will take support of Ms. Raktima Mukhopadhyay-Ex Trustees of CPF and Prof. SB Roy-Chairman Oak Application Form     14IBRAD in conducting research in relation to the project such as environment, forest conservation etc.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING This section is twofold. Please tell us:a) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation system of CPF are based on participatory approaches. The project monitoring system is built on expected outcomes and impact. It assists in tracing the project progress towards achieving the objectives and undertake mid-term corrections as required.Before grounding the project, baseline survey will be undertaken and MIS developed accordingly. The monitoring formats are designed as per outcome indicators. The project information is collected at regular intervals and maintained. The quality of data collection is ensured by the Project officers in the field and later analyzed by the MIS Officer. This is reviewed in a timely manner by the program team. The analyzed reports are shared with stakeholders.Qualitative indicators are captured and documented through regular monitoring visits by project implementing team and Senior Management Team. Monthly planning and review meetings are held at field office and also at Head Office for all the projects. Mid-term and end term evaluation of the projects are being done as per the donor requirement and also keeping in view long term vision of the organization.Learning: Over two decades, while implementing the projects, it was understood that forest-based livelihoods alone are not sufficient for enhancing incomes and conserving natural resources. CPF moved towards promoting agro-ecological practices, horticulture and water resource development. Tribal communities were unable to access basic services and social security schemes because of remoteness and apathy of officials. This led CPF to work with communities and the government on entitlements and sustainable NRM based livelihoods through community-based institutions.Through this grant opportunity from the Oak Foundation to work in the regions of physical and socio-economic vulnerabilities of West Bengal, CPF is hoping to establish that its approach of enhancing income, access to entitlements and promoting agro-ecological practices though community-based institutions in forest fringe villages can be replicated.

If none were received, please leave this section blank. Oak Application Form     17Questions raised by Programme OfficerRationale about the choice of these districts/ blocks over othersHow will the poor implementation of the FRA which is to a large extent driven by the resistance from the Forest Dept be tackled by CPF?Aside from the secondary literature review, did CPF conduct direct learning or scoping exercises to the proposed locations?What is the goal of the project?Can you give an idea about these interventions are built on what is existing? eg are there community institutions on the ground already?SHG groups are there but not strongWater User groups are inactiveFarmers institutions are to be established / constitutedPlease explain the feasibility of these interventions  eg what is the status of land ownership of these communities, water availability, access to agri inputs and markets?What is the present status of management rights of the communities on the community forests? is  this for Bankura ?In the Sundarbans, the tribal communities are often not regarded as indigenous  what will be strategy to enable them to have FR? In general, the FD is very powerful here  how would CPF facilitate the organisation of communities to resist this dominanceCan you describe the key indicators that would be studied during the baseline? Are you planning a direct baseline commissioned by CPF or would it be established through existing secondary data? Questions raised by Trustee, President and Director-India ProgrammeWhat were the factors that led to the collapse of the networks that existed in West Bengal 5-6 years ago?West Bengal has not been identified as a tribal state with the tribal population of about 5% of the total population. NGOs who are working with tribals are focusing on health, education and livelihoods in a welfare approach rather than rights approach. In Sundarbans area the government is focusing on development based on tourism and environment. Sundarbans area because of its porous borders with Bangladesh the cross-border influx of the population has become a security concern for the government and resulting in discouraging the civil society engagement in the region.What would be unique value add of Centre for Peoples Forestry in West Bengal? How will it contribute to the work of other organizations currently working in West Bengal on the same issue?The unique value addition of CPF in West Bengal is its collaborative approach in planning its   interventions involving consultations with all the stakeholders. CPF share its plans and budgets with the government and other stakeholders to mitigate the misconceptions that people have about the financial Oak Application Form     18transparency and in the process CPF gains the trust of the government and other stakeholders.  Depending on the nature of intervention, CPF works with experts, academic institutions and CSO networks. CSO representatives were consulted extensively to understand the relevant issues in West Bengal and the proposal was vetted seeking their inputs. Consultations with various stakeholders will be continued.  This approach helps CPF in realizing the project goals and also establishes CPF as a transparent organization ensuring the CSOs engage with CPF to achieve the common goals by sharing the collective as well as the specialized capacities of all involved stakeholders.CPF worked with 52 NGOs and Vanasmakhya - network of 680 Vana Samrakshana Samitis while facilitating Joint Forest Management and Community Forest Management in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.CPF would network with organization working for tribals and their entitlements in West Bengal also with the vast experience it has gained over the years.Why does CPF wish to work in West Bengal; how well is CPF placed in terms of connections with key departments, peers, staffing etc.? What are some of the factors you consider key for CPF to successfully establish the work in West Bengal?CPF has been aiming to work towards restoration of the forest ecosystem in the Eastern Ghats[1]. In the process, organization is expanding its operational areas and CPF chose to work in West Bengal for the same reason. Because of CPF work earlier with Forest Department, we could easily establish contacts with the Forest Department and also with other departments in West Bengal.While doing the scoping study, CPF contacted IBRAD, PRADAN, CRY, Oxfam  India, CINI, EKJUT, WWF, and researchers working in West Bengal to understand the tribal livelihoods and also the civil society and government engagement on entitlements.CPF has well experienced team to ground a project of this scale and nature in other states and who can mentor the new recruits and provide necessary hand holding support to them. CPF Trustees with varied experience in forestry, environment, climate change, livelihoods and entitlements will guide us in grounding and implementation of the project.Are you expecting other funders to co-fund during the four years of this request?Yes, but not in the first two years of the project. The present BftW supported project cycle is coming to closure by 2024. We will begin the dialogue with them to support part of our West Bengal work from now onwards. We are also planning to approach other donor agencies including government (NABARD) which have shown inclination to work with CPF.  [1] And to realise this goal, a proposal was submitted to HCL last year and CPF reached amongst the top 6 organizations in the bidding process in which 300 organizations participated.Oak Application Form     19",

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):In 1978, some young people established a club for recreational activities for the youth in Kultali block in the district of South 24 Parganas, West Bengal. Again, a major flood that hit the island in 1982 which made youngsters to undertake a series of relief measures, physically helping victims to reach safer places, pleading the government and administration for relief support and organizing the relief camps. This was the turning point in the history of the Club, Baikunthapur Tarun Sangha. The youngsters were struck by the extent of poverty amongst the people on one hand and total lack of apathy and support from other quarters. They realized the vulnerability of the people and the need to contribute towards organized community development. Thus, they resolved to work towards building better facilities for the Grant Application Form, July 1 20136people in need but who didn't know how to obtain. Gradually BTS realized the way it was functioning was not the proper one to make sustainable changes in peoples life. The pioneers involved in the organization had gone through a series of self-evaluation process and felt the concept of people-oriented development process. Next, BTS took up the policy to initiate interventions for community development ensuring peoples involvement and participation of other social institutions like local self-Government (PRIs), youth clubs, external support agencies and other ones.

(300 words):Aangan is governed by an all-women 4 -member Trustee Board, including the founder, and current CEO. The Trustee Board meets quarterly and signs off on major decisions, internal policies, annual plans, and budgets. We have an Advisory Board of 5 women and 2 men who are subject experts and bring a wide range of expertise and experience  Strategic planning, finance and fundraising, communication, etc. This Board meets at least 3 times a year. We currently have an 11-member Senior leadership team, with 3 women at the Director level and 8 Program Heads (7 women and one man).  This year we do expect to expand our senior leadership team in keeping with our work expansion. We are currently a team of 60 people with diverse backgrounds, experience and expertise working in 6 States at present. Our full-time field teams are supported by community mobilizers who work on a part-time basis and are residents of the communities where we work. This number fluctuates based on team and program needs. Our community-based child harm prevention model is led by groups of women volunteers trained and supported by us. They are not volunteers in the usual sense of the word, since it is not the organization they align with, but rather the mission of child protection. This year we have 6000 women volunteers across our areas of work. Aangan is an equal opportunity employer. We dont discriminate based on gender, caste, religion, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc. either during recruitment or appraisals and promotions. We do practice affirmative action with regard to gender and hire more women than men across levels. We believe this is appropriate for an organization that promotes gender equity in its work and programming, besides being practical given most of our interface is with adolescent girls and with women.Oak Application Form     6 5b.

Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)Mission:Aangan strengthens child protection systems to ensure vulnerable children are supported to stay in school, protected from trafficking, child marriage, hazardous work, violence, and exploitation. Our 5-year goal is to make childrens safety a crosscutting issue across sectors. History:2002-2013: Working with child survivors in state-run rescue homes (CCIs). Using a first of its kind Monitoring Tool co-created with UNICEF India we audited CCIs across 16 states to provide strategic inputs on improving standards of care.  Here we understood the importance of preventing harm at the source and started shifting focus accordingly.2009-2015: Understanding that vulnerable children came from vulnerable families and communities, we initiated community-based programs for children, working with families and local authorities, starting in Mumbai and expanding across Maharashtra, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh.2015-2017: This culminated in PACT Parents and Children against Trafficking/Harm ) program that trained community women and leveraged their knowledge to prevent child harm in their communities with a 360-degree view of child safety.2018-2022: Building on PACT  Hotspot to Safe-spot was a district-wide demonstration model in 5 districts (Rajasthan, Bengal, Jharkhand, UP, Bihar), bringing community women volunteers and key authorities (police, education, urban administration) together to create regular dialogue platforms focused on child safety. These resulted in strategies like regular community safety audits shared with police; a family follow-up system for irregular/absent school children; maintaining migrating family registers with GPs. Achievements:Successful Advocacy with Government:oThe state-wide Suraksha Sakhi scheme launched by Rajasthan Police in 2021, is an expansion of Aangan's child-oriented community policing model demonstrated in Bharatpur.Child Safety through the HotSpot to Safespot ModelCommunity volunteers across 5 districts gathered hyperlocal child harm and risk data that informed targeted interventions implemented with authorities that led to ~19K school re-enrolments and averting ~1,600 child marriagesOak Application Form     75c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Global evidence suggests that vulnerable groups such as children are at heightened risk of being exploited in the aftermath of climate disasters. According to ILO, 70 million children are impacted by climate disasters globally every year.[1] Losses incurred during disasters often push families towards dangerous adaptive strategies - migration, taking children out of school, marrying them off, sending them to work, etc. These survival measures, along with the impact of disaster itself profoundly impacts a child's life, exposing her to a plethora of immediate and long-term risks. Moreover, if the frequency of disasters is high, the cycle of risks perpetuates.  West Bengal, with a history of climate vulnerability and 15 districts susceptible to extreme climate events, has witnessed multiple risk cycles. The issue that was alarming to begin with has been exacerbated owing to rapid climate change. Since 2019, Bengal has faced three major tropical cyclones - Bulbul, Amphan and Yaas. Aangan has worked in N 24 Parganas since 2017, demonstrating a community-based child harm prevention model to address child trafficking, child marriage and child labour, issues already established as endemic to the area. We work closely with community women volunteer groups who gather hyperlocal data and information and work with stakeholders and families on finding solutions. We are therefore privy to how child harm and risks are exacerbated manifold because of the frequent recurrence of serious climate events in this region and have also worked with community groups towards solutions. Our experience shows: Medium to Long-term aftermath of disasters on families and children:oDegradation and salinity of agricultural land and coastal erosion has forced changes in livelihood and sustenance patterns and loss of livelihood leading to migration (sometimes leaving children behind) and increased child labour: In a joint initiative with GPs, 14744 families were identified by community groups as being forced to migrate for work and were provided with key information about safe practicesoChildren dropping out of school and a change in perception of the relevance of education: 7972 children at risk of dropping out were supported with remedial classes and re-enrolled in schoolOak Application Form     8oIncreased child marriages: community groups prevented 429 child marriagesoChild labour  children are entering the work force younger and are also in hazardous work: 10698 children in or at risk of child labour pulled out of child labour and linked back to schooloAnecdotal data from community women and from children (particularly girls) points to an increase in trafficking in the guise of offers for marriage and workoIncrease in the number of child-headed families: 589 child-headed families were identified and brought under the supervision of community groups State governments set operational priorities during disaster response which determine the allocation of resources and response strategies for the whole state. Within this its particularly important for the approach at the district-level to be sensitive to the needs of children.  Unfortunately, this is not the case. State and district-level disaster management plans in Bengal dont say much about children. In S24 Parganas plans there is mention of a need for psychological support to vulnerable groups including children, and the N24 Parganas plans briefly mention children as a group in reference to disaster awareness and preparedness drives at schools (pre-disaster) and food and clothing requirement at the relief camps (post-disaster). Child and women's safety are briefly referred to under Law and Order Safety Measures.  Our experience shows its urgent that child protection work be embedded inside resilience building and risk reduction as a part of addressing climate change. This is the gap we seek to address [1] https://www.ilo.org/manila/public/pr/WCMS_558093/lang--en/index.htm",

        "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  How will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are planning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived experience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  Why are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are choosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you usually work? (300 words):For children to be safe, multiple actors across sectors must be involved, especially in climate hazard zones where the survival strategies of family/community impact children directly. 1. Partnering with community: It is the primary partnership because:oHow families cope with disaster affects children.oCommunities must understand child harm in all its dimensions to determine priorities as stakeholders.oNarrative change is needed for harm that has been normalized/seems inevitableoCo-creating solutions with community is sustainable Year 1 focuses on community engagement through stakeholder mobilization, for exampleSHG groups, children, youth, Krishi Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas. Oak Application Form     13By Q4, communities will select a Community Resource Group (GP-level) as a key agent of change for the remainder of the project.This strategy builds on our successful evidence-based model.  2. Partnering with CSOs: Collaborating with organizations in affected districts to build an advocacy movement for inclusion of child safeguarding (indicators, and resources) with the State and other relevant private entities.   Y1: informal meetingsY2: formalized through convening joint workshops and sharing and learning sessionsY3: developing joint course of action which may include generating evidence of best practice 3. Partnering with Local Authorities: Building on learnings from ground-level, we will aim for informal and/or formal cooperation with GPs, schools and other local functionaries to build platforms to hear from and about children concerning safety as well as to find solutions and mitigate risks. Solutioning is a key activity of the project as it builds evidence for best practices. 4. Engagement with Influencers: Involving other actors, including subject experts, government and non-government functionaries, and media through the course of project, to build broader consensus and endorsement for the generated evidence to raise child safety as an important issue that needs addressing in the context of climate change and towards advocacy with the State.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING This section is twofold. Please tell us:a) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please describe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):Oak Application Form     14A mixed-method approach comprising tools to measure knowledge levels, actions undertaken and the operationalization of hyper-local action plans will be developed and deployed.- We will use monitoring trackers for different stakeholders that capture key outputs. The tools include: Official Register Tracker, Community Resource Group Tracker, Minutes of Meetings format, Out-of-School Children and Attendance Tracker.- To assess their knowledge, attitudes and capabilities to respond and gauge their improvement of awareness on CS (Child Safety)- signs, laws and services- a baseline, midline and endline survey will be administered.- Case Study Tracker captures qualitative data theme-wise. Key Indicators for:  Objective 1% Improvement in perception of community about CS % Increase in agency and confidence of resource group members% Increase in actionable knowledge among group members% Increase in children attending school regularly (>=75%)% Increase in child harm cases averted out of the identified Objective 2Improved prioritization and willingness of GP to improve child supervision and family resilience % GPs adopting CS & well-being interventions in disasterA proof of concept for the demonstrated model by Aangan, which identifies best practices and recommendations for improving CS in disaster for advocacy purposes Objective 3# of CSOs in agreement to include a CS lens in their programmatic outcomes and indicators. Learning:The more significant aspect of MEL is the learning that will contribute to strengthening the state/district systems to better provide for children in the emerging climate-driven crisis. The project will answer the following key questions:  Oak Application Form     15- What are the risks (different from family-level risks) prioritized by communities for actioning, and how they hold themselves and local authorities accountable?- What mechanisms work to ensure sustained dialogue with resulting actions?- How does CS become relevant to and shared responsibility for CSOs building community resilience/risk reduction/adaptation",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):1. The Occurrence of Serious Climate Events: this is always a possibility as this is an extremely high-risk region. As our experience shows, this changes or at least delays project plans as the work on the ground necessarily shifts focus to crisis management. Year 1 needs community engagement which is not at all feasible should such an issue arise. The tragic flip side is of course that one gets to build evidence- it just may not be with community involvement. 2. Community Push-back: Many child harms that occur are a result of survival strategies families adopt  for example child labor, or leaving children without appropriate care due to migration. Communities are more able to have these honest conversations when real alternatives exist. Sometimes these are possible through linkage to state support, schemes and programs  these are strategies that we have used in the past and will use again. They require government cooperation too- which can also be tricky to negotiate, especially if it is not an area of the governments focus. 3. Lack of Interest from State/District: The States buy-in will depend on how relevant the issue of child protection is for them, especially true for 2023-24 in the run-up to the general election. This will also impact what they prioritize in the district with regard to schemes and services. Availability of panchayats and local officials may also be affected. Building a ground-up demand for child safety is all the more important.Oak Application Form     16 4. Initiating Work in a New District: we will be initiating work in S. 24 Parganas where we dont have relationships. This is not a huge risk as much as some wariness about the teething issues that arise in a new area of work as well as unanticipated delays that may occur because of it.",

If none were received, please leave this section blank. Modality of Working with Partners: In N 24 Parganas we have been demonstrating our model in partnership with 2 community based organizations ASHA (https://www.asha4change.org/) and Sristy for Human Society (who have been selected post a process of due diligence) and who have been operational in the area and have a deep understanding of the context, challenges, govt and local structures.  Aangan designs and develops the program structure and model, all training content, curricula,, tools and resources to be used by the community and other stakeholders involved. In addition the monitoring frameworks, tools for gathering evidence and tracking progress are also developed by Aangan.  The model and activities are implemented by partner team members in the field. Regular and ongoing training is provided on all of the above by Aangan staff to Partner teams so that implementation is smooth. Monitoring and tracking progress against indicators is done jointly by both.  Quarterly convenings are organized to share trends, challenges, best practices and to ensure qualitative learnings from the ground is being captured and worked on.  We have been working with these partners since 2015. Our decision to work with CBOs is driven partially by expedience, but more importantly to also support and promote work of smaller organisations working in the region. Going forward this is how we intend to work:N 24 Parganas  8 blocks, Aangan will work directly through its own field team (some existing and some to be hired)Oak Application Form     17In S 24 Parganas, Aangan will follow a similar structure described above and work together with a partner/s. The proposed project will be co-funded along with 2 other partners. The sub-grant for partners will NOT be a part of the budget for Oak, but will be covered by a grant from our Indian funder.",

Governing body elected by the Annual General Meeting is the highest executive body for policy implementation. Office bearers like President, Vice-President, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurers are responsible for monitoring activities. Of late a Management Committee has been appointed to execute the day-to-day activities. The Management Committee includes office bearers and two other staff who are also members.There is a team of staff of around 30 who implement the decisions of the Managing Committee and functions on full time basis.There is a good number of volunteers who help the organization to implement the planned activities in different sectors against small amount remuneration, honorarium or travel support. Thereare also some interns who work with us from time to time. There have been continuous efforts to strengthen the leadership structure with the participation of community based activists and women. More involvement of the office bearers and governing body members in the existing structure is being planned.   5b. Summarise the organisations history.  In addition, highlight 2-3 key achievements.Please keep this brief and list up to 3 key achievements as bullet points. Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)vSociety for Direct Initiative for Social and Health Action (DISHA) was registered on 12.09.1995 under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act 1961. Since inception DISHA has been active on different issues concerning environment, environmental health and human rights.Since 2000 DISHA has been involved in protection of coastal environment on the issues of beach protection, destruction of fish resources, protection of marine bio-diversity, unscrupulous tourism, unsafe industrialization, etc. DISHA started working with the traditional small scale fishing communitieswho are the natural custodians of coasts and protect environment for their livelihood through sustainable fishing. Three key achievements in fisheries sector -Since 2003 DISHA became involved in protection of bio-diversity in Sundarban and livelihood of the fisher people who depend upon forest resources since ages. Later the issue of implementation of Forest Rights Act was taken up. DISHA conducted a study in 2009 on the Livelihood Problems of Traditional Fishers in Protected Area (www.dishaearth.org). Since 2012, DISHA became involved with inland fisheries. Policy issues like tenure rights of the small fishers, protection of their livelihood, saving the water bodies were taken up. DISHA started advocating for policies at both national and state level in favour of small-scale fishers for sustainable use of fisheries resources.Oak Application Form     7At the ground level DISHA had been engaged in organising and supporting fish workers collectives in nine southern districts of West Bengal viz., Dakshin 24 Parganas, Uttar 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Jhargram, Nadia, Murshidabad. In North Bengal DISHA is engaged in supporting collectivization of small-scale fish workers in 5 districts - Malda, Uttar Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar and Alipurduar. DISHA has also been instrumental in formation of a national platform of small scale fish workers organisations in 20 states and UTs.DISHA has been supporting the small-scale fish workers campaign on right to water and natural resources, campaigns and legal intervention to stop pollution in a trans-boundary river Mathabhanga, caused by a distillery in Bangladesh, cleaning of Churni and Ichamati rivers in Nadia, rejuvenation of Buriganga river in Nadia and Bidyadhari river in Dakshin 24 Parganas, campaigns against use of mosquito net in rivers and water bodies of Murshidabad and Jalpaiguri, campaigns on several tenure rights issues like fish workers occupational identity card, credit cards, provision of implements, accident insurance, boat registration etc.5c.

If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):Theory of change exercises helped us to identify and understand the main problems of the sector where we work. Also our experience and research provided us with guidance to identify the main problems and the approach to address those. The ToC exercise also helped us to identify the areas of collaboration with the Oak partners in an appropriate manner in the fisheries sector.  Apart from ToC exercise and our policy intervention, rigorous consultations with the stake holder communities at various levels helped us to specify the problems and approach to be taken to address those problems. Our intended activities utilizing the Oak funds are also being proposed on the basis of the above -  Problems Approach Activities to be undertakenMarine Fisheries1.

Highlight any significant recent or expected future changes. If you have an explicit approach to increasing diversity and/or advancing race equity within the organisation, please tell us. (300 words):KABIL is governed by a Governing Board having distinguished professionals. The eight honorary members on the Board function in their personal capacities. Executive Director of KABIL, the ninth member, acts as the ex-officio secretary. 3 of the eight honorary members are women. The Executive Director of KABIL was conferred the Distinguished Alumnus award by the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur last year.KABIL follows a flat hierarchy. The Executive Director is the first employee of the organisation. Other employees are appointed by him. The programme Oak Application Form     6director (level 3) reports to the Executive Director, the project leader (Level 2) reports to the Programme Director and the executive (level 1) reports to the project leader. While the category of professionals ends here, some associates assist in different functions. It is a policy in KABIL that as far as possible professional staff will directly engage with the communities and there are no positions in between. When necessary, however, volunteers are recruited temporarily, a recent instance being the COVID vaccination programme.Currently, KABIL has 20 full-time staff. 12 of them are in the professional category and the rest eight are associates. In addition, 3 experts work on a retainer basis, providing part of their time for KABIL. The Executive Director has more than three decades of experience in rural development. The experts have a similar experience span. Among other professional staff, experience varies between seventeen years and one year. While KABIL has no written down policy to increase diversity or advance race equity, we consciously promote these while recruiting staff. 9 of the twenty full-time staff are women. The staff hail from different regions of the country, and they belong to three religions.There is a possibility of the current Executive Director superannuating during the proposed project period and a new incumbent taking over. 5b. Summarise the organisations history.  In addition, highlight 2-3 key achievements.Please keep this brief and list up to 3 key achievements as bullet points. Even though you may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the proposed grant. (300 words)KABIL was incorporated at the end of 2012 and started its operations in early 2014. During the first four years, KABIL provided on-site project implementation support to other organisations for livelihood enhancement of the rural poor. Concentrating in North-east India, it provided such support to other NGOs and the NERLP (World Bank funded).  It also trained all the frontline functionaries of the Government of Jharkhand on livelihood promotion through natural resource management (NRM). KABIL currently works with the Assam State Rural Livelihoods Mission, Government of Assam (ASRLM) to promote climate-resilient livelihoods for members of womens self-help groups in Udalguri district of Assam. It works in Tikamgarh of Madhya Pradesh to develop water resources for livelihood promotion. It also works with NGOs in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to harness Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for durable individual asset creation.Some salient achievements include:1. Popularising micro-irrigation pumps among smallholders in rural Kamrup of Assam2. Facilitating as many as 702 individual livelihood assets in the form of farm ponds and pigsties harnessing INR 8.58 Crore (USD 1.13 million) from the MGNREGS for an equal number of rural beneficiaries in a Oak Application Form     7single community development block (Udalguri) over 4 years (2018-22). In this project, as per a recent sample survey, out of the 1920 households with whom at least three livelihood interventions were made, 59% increased their annual income between 1 lakh and 1.49 lakh because of project interventions.3. There is more demand now for KABIL from the Government. The ASRLM has invited KABIL to provide design and implementation support for their Integrated Farming Cluster Programme, The District Administration of Udalguri has asked KABIL to expand its activities to different blocks and the District Administration of Tikamgarh (Madhya Pradesh) has invited KABIL to become their technical support agency.5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):We want to address the problem of livelihood and income vulnerability of tea garden families in the closed and sick tea gardens of West Bengal. The majority of the tea garden workers are Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes) who are socially at the margins too. while the condition of workers across tea gardens is far from satisfactory, the vulnerability is acute in the closed and sick tea gardens.The problem was identified through our understanding of poverty pockets in West Bengal and two exploratory visits by us to the proposed project area. We discussed the problems and issues with the communities, government officials, elected representatives of the local self-government institutions and leaders of the tea garden workers. Secondary information, research etc. were also consulted. For example, Sengupta, Naskar and Datta (March 2021) describe the historical context of the current condition of the tea workers. Bera (2014) describes the poverty in the particular areas we visited and the more than 1000 reported starvation deaths since 2002. Ansari and Sheereen  (2016) describe the vulnerability of tea workers when a tea garden is locked out or the work is temporarily suspended.Our first-hand information indicates the following:Most of those who are still employed work as temporary workers. The most they can expect is 132 days of work in a year at Rs 202 per day. The rest is earned through other casual means. Migration is common. Except for those who migrate to places like Kerala or find occasional work through MGNREGS, the wages earned are always less than tea garden wages. Finding menial jobs in the nearby towns is another commonly used means. Facilitated by labour contractors, younger women and men, many of them school dropouts, travel long distances regularly to functioning tea gardens and other places to do wage work. Labour contractors take their commission from these wage earners. There is a significant transport cost and time involved in travel. Jobs available in other tea gardens are the ones which the local workers of the tea Oak Application Form     8garden would not prefer. Collecting stones and boulders from the nearby riverbanks and selling them to middlemen is a common occupation. Stone and boulder collection is a hard job and can at best earn Rs 150 (USD 2) a day. Farming and animal husbandry in the homesteads supplement income. All these together can earn a family Rs 50,000 on average.  The government is using MGNREGS to provide wages to tea garden families. There is also a Foula system in the closed tea gardens through which the State Government pays Rs 1,500 (USD 20) per month to only the erstwhile permanent workers till they attain the age of 58.Many of the dwelling units of the tea garden families, which were built by the tea garden management decades back, are in dilapidated condition in the absence of repair. Electricity and water, which were earlier provided by the tea garden are no longer available from them in the closed tea gardens. In the sick ones, the services often get interrupted because of payment and other issues. In closed tea gardens like Surendranagar and Redbank, the tea plantation area has turned into jungles. This has increased the menace of elephants.Through this project, we specifically attempt to enhance the income equity of the tribal and other vulnerable populations in the tea gardens who remain at the margins. We also attempt to foster gender equality and inclusion of women by working predominantly with women and their groups which enhances their decision-making space and leadership.",

Helping the families to implement their livelihood plans. Initially, the focus would be on stabilizing and scaling up the existing activities of livestock rearing and backyard poultry that are most widespread. The second set of activities would focus on using the homestead lands for improved cultivation of vegetables and other cash crops. Fallow lands which are part of the tea garden area will be made suitable for cropping through land and water development. Attempts will be made to use the shade trees in the plantation area for cash cropping like black pepper (no outputs are committed).f.

(300 words):Oak Application Form     11The project is by its very nature a collaborative one. Outcomes cannot be achieved without the involvement of stakeholders. As we explored the area, we introduced ourselves and discussed the problems and issues with the government functionaries, the elected representatives of the local self-government institutions, and leaders of the tea workers trade unions. As a result, we were introduced to the communities by the government functionaries working in the respective blocks.As we venture into the project, we would also explore collaboration with partners of Oak Foundation. We understand that some of them operate in the area or are planning to operate. In addition to gaining insights from them, we also expect great complementarity and further energizing of the initiatives of all the concerned partners.A collaboration with West Bengal State Rural Livelihood Mission will be much sought after because the womens SHGs promoted by them are expected to be an important platform for action. KABIL is already working with the State Rural Livelihood Mission in the adjoining state of Assam and has gained experience in collaboration with such an entity.Financial institutions like banks and market actors will have to be tapped. Communities need access to credit for their livelihood initiatives; they also require input and output linkages with the market. Relevant industry bodies like the India Tea Association will be consulted on issues and their cooperation will be sought.Last but not least, we do realise that the situation in the tea gardens is complex and more insight is needed. There are many academics and there is a wealth of research on issues in tea gardens. It will be our constant endeavour to seek input from academics and available knowledge.",

If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.b) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or test through this grant.(300 words):As mentioned earlier, by end of the project period, 2,500 households are expected to earn Rs. 25,000 additional income over the current mean income of Rs 50,000. This is done in a way that includes women and sustainability is ensured. The outcome assessment will be done at the end of the project through an evaluation to be undertaken by a competent third party.We plan to conduct a baseline survey of the area while initiating the project. Data regarding the livelihood status of individual families will also be captured as they enter the project. These will act as the benchmark. An M&E framework including MIS will be developed for this project as we begin. Progress Oak Application Form     12parameters will be captured on an ongoing basis through the MIS. Some of the indicators for measurement on a periodic basis include:Number of SHGs/community groups that KABIL is working withNumber of livelihood plans made by themVolume of finance leveraged by the groupsNumber of groups monitoring the implementation of the livelihood plansNumber of households adopting improved livestock rearing and/or homestead garden practicesArea covered by natural resource development interventionsAdditional land area brought under cultivationCash crops introducedIncome realized by the families due to project interventions, etc.Sample surveys and case studies will be undertaken at the end of each year and reported.Unlike in most cases where agri-based interventions are done on land belonging to the households, in this project the land does not belong to them.  The most important area of learning for us will be how to work in tea gardens and the tea garden community benefit from the development of land that does not belong to them.  This is a new area for KABIL and this grant allows the testing of this assumption.",
        "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your outcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?We understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we expect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be open to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your outcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? (300 words):The risks are as under:a. The closed tea gardens have no current owners. So no consultation with the owners is possible for the activities on tea garden lands. If and when new owners are found by the government, they may not allow cultivation activities on those lands. We understand that finding owners for these tea gardens is difficult because of the deteriorated plantations and several pending court cases. Nevertheless, the project will remain in touch with the government so that any new negotiation accommodates the changed reality of the gardens. b. Elections in the local self-government institutions (PRIs) are due in May 2023. Any change in political composition thereafter can impede the Oak Application Form     13relationship. To circumvent this, the project will make its apolitical stance explicit before all stakeholders.c. Allocation under MGNREGS may be reduced by the central/state governments which will adversely affect fund leverage. In such a scenario, the project will have to tap other schemes and sources to compensate for the reduction.d. The womens SHGs formed by the Livelihood Mission may not be in a good shape to work with. In an extreme scenario, the Mission may not allow the project access to the SHGs. While we have a prima facie assurance from the local government functionaries that the project can work with the SHGs, it may have to put in additional effort to first strengthen the SHGs to work with them.The opportunities include a) a huge area of uncultivated lands which can be utilized for cultivation purposes, b) the governments concern about the wellbeing of the workers of the closed tea gardens c) Good road connectivity d) high rainfall in the area that creates a high potential for water harvesting e) Tea (Promotion and Development) bill 2022 which aims at improving the tea industry, etc.",

Our contribution has been appreciated by BCAS, a Bangladeshi Research Organisation.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):DRCSC focuses on working with marginal community who are most vulnerable and resource poor and live in ecologically fragile zones. It works with the entire household with main focus on women. It ensures equal participation, providing best opportunity to learn, dream and fulfil their dream through promotion of low Grant Application Form, July 1 20137cost sustainable NRM models and convergences with different government schemes and services.DRCSCs currents areas of involvement is as follows :1. To build capacities of vulnerable communities and encourage them to get involved in participatory action research (that are environment friendly, economically feasible, socially equitable & viable) to develop climate change adaptive models in agriculture and allied sectors in the ecologically fragile zones.2. To increase and sustain income opportunities of the ultra-poor families through diversification of the sources of income with focus to farm and non-farm initiatives.3. To assess the possibilities of resources available in different agro climatic region and build capacities of the adolescents and youth through short term courses on natural resource based vocations so that they can process such resources and develop small enterprises either individually or collectively or earn livelihood as instructors.4. To support small and marginal farmers engaged in producing organic products to establish backward and forward linkages in marketing. 5. Consolidate our identity as a Resource Organisation for ecological agriculture and extend capacity building services at all levels like farmers, field workers, organisers, individuals and organisations interested to promote organic farming in South and South East Asia.6.

To Document knowledge of indigenous resources and how they are utilised. Help in developing efficient collection method & processing technology of under-utilised or lesser known plants & animal resources.6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):The Sundarbans ecosystem is one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the Indian Sub-continent. The UNESCO designated world heritage site plays a key role as the regions carbon sink soaking in around 4.15 crore tonnes of carbon dioxide (2011). However, the regions rich bio-diversity and burgeoning human population stand at a brink today with increasing threats to their very existence from exogenous climate induced shocks and its aftereffects. The principal land-based livelihoods get impacted due to increased salinity, lack of knowledge with regard to sustainable agriculture, no options for diversified agriculture etc. due to which more and more people are exploiting the natural resource base in a manner that will be difficult to sustain over the long run. Grant Application Form, July 1 20138Frequent climatic hazards (saline flood, cyclone etc) are disrupting the livelihood over and above. Agricultural lands are being converted into prawn farming ponds (Bheri) which is again not sustained livelihood option at all. The proposed interventions will be emphasized on orientation on different techniques and methods of climate adaptive agriculture, livestock farming, aquaculture, and other on-farm and non-farm income generation programmes which ultimately will help the community to diversify their income opportunities and thereby will lead to increase climate resilience. The interventions will consist of establishing seed banks through which the targeted households will be able to conserve salt-tolerant seeds for future, they will be able to learn to prepare nutrition gardens at each and every possible space they have around their homestead to get assured nutrition with their daily meals round the year. The biggest problem of Sundarbans, river bank erosion will be tried to be addressed through plantation of mangroves and protecting those plants to reduce the problem. Rain water will be harvested through different rain water harvesting structures which may help in increasing the availability of irrigation during the stress period. The facilities will be established so that the increased production of the farmers can be aggregated, value added and marketed through a cluster based approach. The proposed intervention aims at addressing the non-availability of a facilitative platform for vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to come together, diagnose their vulnerabilities and act upon the same. Such a platform has been elusive on account of high opportunity cost of participation of vulnerable groups in processes of development, lack of any favourable prior experiences, and increasing alienation from their core habitat and livelihoods.",

Total Amount requested from Oak:998595Grant Application Form, July 1 201344g. Summarise the projects ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)The Projects ultimate goal is to Reduce Socio economic vulnerability, improve livelihoods and resilience of 9,000 Tea worker communities in 5 districts of North Bengal and Assam namely- Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong, Darjeeling, in North Bengal and Sonitpur, Biswanath in Assam . The work will be undertaken across 35 gardens of which 25 gardens in North Bengal and 10 gardens in Assam. Tea worker communities constitute one of the most isolated and marginalised communities amongst various plantation workers. Having been uprooted from their native places, their lives across generations have remained confined to gardens with limited interaction with outside communities. Being under the sole authority of respective garden management, the workers have little security and safety nets other than those provided by Garden management, long working hours, lack of work security, low literacy and low skill sets have made this segment of population particularly marginalised, Further, this affects women and youth the most in terms of poor health conditions of women, malnutrition amongst the population, disenchantment amongst youth. Most often young boys and girls, out of sheer desperation take risks of uninformed migration, falling victims to trafficking and other forms of abuse. The project will be the first phase of a multi-phase intervention where the project will facilitate building of community voices and create opportunities and choices for Tea worker households. We have limited our intervention specifically to cover Tea workers and to some extent workers in Small Tea Gardens who are relatives of workers in Large and Closed Tea gardens. Small Tea Growers are not covered within the ambit of the current phase given their varied profile and more mainstream identity compared to workers in Tea estates who are covered under Plantation Labour Act. In this phase the primary focus will be to improve livelihoods and safety nets through a participatory process of needs, resources, skills and opportunity identification leading to diversification and improvement in incomes. Secondly, collectivisation of women and youth in the gardens and enhancing their knowledge, skills and sense of agency will improve their negotiation and dialogue capacities with officials within and outside the gardens enabling them to access entitlements from the Government. We see this as a critical intervention towards Trade justice  which depends a lot of building capacities of the community itself to identify and raise their issues and stand up for their own rights The project will also establish a model of climate adaptive practices through establishing small scale innovations in two Gardens and facilitate formation of informal CSO group for peer to peer learning, broadbased understanding of Labour Code and its dissemination, joint assessment of advocacy issues and actions for policy.",

Describe the financial situation (include information on annual operating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected changes. (maximum 300 words):Grant Application Form, July 1 20136As of 2019/20 Traidcraft Exchange had overall unrestricted reserves of 19k. We are expecting to at least break even at an operating level in 2020/21 and our budget for 2021/22 shows operating costs of .096m with income of circa .14m. We currently have no long-term liabilities on our balance sheet and little current debt. We are currently going through a restructure, which is focusing on the organisation as a whole in order to cut costs but also to make us more efficient in raising funds from our existing donor base, including individual donors, trusts and foundations and other philanthropists.In terms of fundraising, we were quick to adapt to the Covid crisis and unrestricted fundraising efforts have weathered Covid restrictions well as the charity has a fairly large, loyal donor base who have continued to give philanthropically throughout the lockdown periods.Our public fundraising strategy seeks to focus resources on high return on investment, philanthropic activity such as appeals, regular giving and legacy. With regards our restricted funding strategy we currently operate an institutional funding model whereby we seek funding from institutions such as Comic Relief, National Lottery Community Fund, the UK government and the EU to fund projects designed and delivered by Traidcraft Exchange in collaboration with local partners. However, the NGO and INGO funding landscape is shifting. We are seeking to adapt our current funding model in light of this and beginning in the next financial year we will start to seek funding from a much broader range of funders.6c.

Traidcraft has policy expertise on purchasing practices, corporate governance and accountability, fair and ethical trade, and international trade policy, including working with the UK government on trade policies post Brexit. Our work in India has revolved around complex and labour-intensive value chains such as tea, textile, cotton and jute, supporting about 150,000 households. TX India has worked with a range of target groups, including women from ethnic minorities and tribes.In the tea sector for example, our work in India has benefited 70,000 small tea growers, with recognition of this sub-sector for the first time in the 11th Five Year Plan. We also supported the set-up of a Small Grower Directorate, the formation of the Confederation of Small Tea Grower Associations, and the co-option of Small Grower representatives on the Tea Board.Who Picked My Tea campaign facilitated by Traidcraft enabled the tea sector to move from complete silence over sourcing to gaining increased transparency in the tea sector in the UK enabling consumers to track the tea they drink from leaf to cup.We are currently implementing the Pahadiya Samriddhi project in Jharkhand which aims to reduce vulnerabilities of 3000 Pahariya (Primitive Tribe) households by providing better access to markets and improve management of natural resourcesWe launched the first fair trade label in India called Shop for Change which is now managed by a private body, and our cotton project helped test the first Fairtrade standards for cotton by the Fairtrade Foundation in the early 2000s. Additionally, our work in the textiles sector has enabled the 12th Five Year Plan to focus on the occupational health & safety of artisans.Currently, we are working with Adivasi and Dalit communities in Madhya Pradesh to address the systemic and structural vulnerabilities of agricultural communities to forced, bonded and child labour. We support the creation of alternate avenues of income generation, and of peoples institutions that work together to prevent exploitation.We are also currently growing our expertise on modern slavery issues in agricultural supply chains, improved working conditions for invisible workers in the textiles sector (particularly homeworkers), and the promotion of sustainable agriculture.6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 words):Traidcraft Exchange uses the power of trade to bring about lasting solutions to poverty. We are on the side of people who are most vulnerable in trade - marginalised workers and producers whose work goes unseen and whose voices go unheard. We aim to support the most vulnerable groups including women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. Grant Application Form, July 1 20138 TX is committed to transforming ourselves from a UK-centric model into a locally rooted, globally connected organisation.  Pursuing this model enables us to devolve responsibility and decision-making to our in-country teams and beyond that, to cede power to the producers and workers who we are supporting. The overarching aim is to put communities in the driving seat of decisions and processes related to their lives and livelihoods by using participatory methodologies and listening to communities and partners.  In this context, Traidcraft Exchanges core purpose is to identify, support and invest in farmer associations, worker collectives, social enterprises and civil society organisations that are challenging the negative impacts of mainstream trade and developing alternative business models that put people and planet first. We will be standing alongside communities who are vulnerable and have been marginalised, supporting them to develop businesses that work for them, that protect and respect their local eco-systems and that build their resilience. And in doing this, we will support them to build their power. Our UK advocacy and campaigns work will complement this work and be rooted in the lived experiences of farmers and workers and the priorities of advocacy partners in-country, addressing the systemic and structural issues affecting peoples lives. Further, some of the key lessons derived from our past work in the tea sector (including programmatic work in India and policy/ campaigning work in the UK level) that forms part of the strategy for this project are:Need to engage with multiple stakeholders (including the garden management, supply chain actors, government institutions like tea Board, TRA) to be effective on-ground. We have planned for such engagements in the current application, whereby we shall involve garden management team in specific workstream; and also plan to do dissemination events including multiple stakeholders.Creating community-based platforms for sustaining work in future phase. In our work with small tea growers (STG), as part of the EqualiTea project, we facilitated STG associations at ground level, including national level STG federation taking forward the work with relevant stakeholders. These community institutions (associations and federation) are still active more than a decade since the project timeframe. In the current programme plan, we have kept provision for creating community collectives of women and youth in the Tea garden communities. These community institutions will provide us the platform for work in the next phase of programmes (especially as we tackle some of the sensitive issues such as human trafficking and gender based violence in tea garden communities in future phase of work)   Campaigning and media engagement does help in highlighting key issues with brands and buyers: Traidcraft policy and campaigning unit, continuously engage with UK based consumers to pressurize brands and companies to adopt ethical sourcing practices. We have run effective campaigns for Tea sector (such as #WhopickedmyTea campaign; https://traidcraftexchange.org/tea-answers ) for greater transparency in supply chains of leading UK based tea brands. We are looking to take advantage of the network of our Policy unit to disseminate information about our project activities to a wider audience with reach to international brands and buyers.Grant Application Form, July 1 201396e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and challenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):The tea industry in India is the countrys second largest employer in the formal sector. A large proportion of the tea produced in India comes from the four States of Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Directly and indirectly, the industry employs over 3 million people, a majority of whom are women. Indian tea remains an important supplier to the global market even as the domestic consumption base increases. Our study on the tea industry has focused on the conditions of workers in the tea gardens of Assam and West Bengal. The study covered a total of 15 large tea estates (LTE); 23 small tea growers (STGs) and 6 closed tea estates (CTEs) across the four clusters of Assam and West Bengal, interviewing a total of 308 tea worker respondents. We have also sought to understand some of the challenges faced by the industry as a whole. We have scanned research reports on these topics from within the industry as well as from independent academic researchers and institutions. We have also spoken to industry leaders as well as civil society organizations working with tea workers. Key problems of the tea workers are:Alienation and Lost Identity: Most workers in the tea estates especially in Assam are descendants of workers who came to Assam under the indentured labour arrangements of British India. They trace their roots to the Adivasi Communities- mostly Mundas and Oraons of the Central India Belt- Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Today they are recognized as Tea and Ex  Tea Garden tribes and recognized as Other Backward Classes by the Government of Assam. In West Bengal, since Colonial times the workers were not indentured. Instead, plantation owners recruited them mostly from Nepal, with some monetary compensation. Besides this, the workers are also santhals and adivasis from central India such as Oraons and Mundas. The incentives were mostly non-monetary in nature and included housing. These houses continued to belong to the plantations and workers were only allowed to live and are expected to maintain the house for as long as they occupy them. Uprooted from their original roots, the workers are not connected to their social community. Living in isolated gardens with limited means of communication and exposure, most workers live only as Tea workers with other identities almost insignificant. Aggravating this is the hostility and alienation faced from the natives of the state- especially Assam due to which the Tea worker community face estrangement and a sense of lost identity.Working conditions of workers: Our secondary research has brought up many individual studies (Oxfam-2019, Banerji and Willoughby-2019, University of Sheffield-2018, Behal-2017, CEE-2009), that describe the difficult living and working conditions of tea workers. The colonial legacy of the industry continues to inform the relationship between the management of tea gardens and their workers. The workers unions that represent the workers collective interests have been unable to represent these issues and have been vulnerable to the influences of mainstream political parties and estate management. The national laws governing the industry, specifically the Plantations Labour Act, 1951, have many enabling provisions but compliance monitoring is inadequate. The Act stipulates that all tea estates shall provide to its workers amenities such a drinking water, separate toilets, medical facilities, creches for child care, canteens, recreational facilities, educational facilities and housing facilities. Our primary data suggests poor availability of these facilities across all categories of the tea gardens. Less Grant Application Form, July 1 201310than a third of study participants reported satisfaction with the quality of the housing they lived in. Drinking water is a serious issue in the gardens affecting women the most. Coupled with this, poor nutrition , very hard nature of work result in health complications of women members in particular. The issue of low wages has been a consistent problem in the tea sector and has been a long-drawn struggle for tea workers. The wages of tea estate works are neither aligned to MGNERGA norms nor anything in line with indices of the consumer price index. The vulnerable workers often become victims of one upmanship between trade unions & employers who often work at cross purposes.            Lack of awareness of workers and poor linkages to government schemes: Our study highlights low levels of awareness among workers. In responses to questions about work promotions, only 7% of the participants in the LTE replied in the affirmative. The issue of inadequate wages has been reported by many participants. However, only 27% of the participants showed awareness of regular deductions from their wages. A third of the participants said that it was difficult to access government schemes and within that group 50% are women.. The reasons that they cited for this include the lack of awareness about the schemes, lack of necessary documents and lack of timely information on the process to be followed, general apathy of government officials towards tea worker community  Low family income, unemployment and underemployment: Low wages, poor access to education and social differences with neighbouring communities have all contributed to a poor capital accumulation within the tea workers community. Most of them do not possess land or if they do (as among the West Bengal tea workers), it is just enough for homestead garden plots. Small livestock rearing is challenging due to the lack of space and common land. Participants reporting access to school beyond the primary level were only 18% of the sample and to high school only2%. A little under half of the participants cite financial difficulties as the reason for the discontinuation of their education. This circumstance has spawned several other social problems such as bonded labour, child labour, destitution and trafficking of women and children. The nature of hiring workers within the tea industry & growing aspirations of youth creates a context of underemployment and unemployment within the tea estates. This forces youth to migrate out to urban centres in search of more gainful employment, often trapped and exploited by the traffickers.Climate and sustainability of the tea sector: On another front, the tea industry is vulnerable to climate change. Extreme climactic events affect both production and processing cycles of the tea crop. These changes in the meteorological factors have also a negative impact on the number & severity of incidences of pests and disease infestations, soil quality and soil erosion. If this trend continues, large parts where tea is grown currently will become unviable for commercial tea production in two to three decades. The industry is also facing multiple problems related to output price stagnation, higher factor costs of production, ageing of the bushes in the organized estates, labour shortages & absenteeism, regulatory hurdles, lack of policy support & reforms, current market structure & the gradual shifting of consumer preference towards other beverages. Given the complex multi-layered issues of vulnerability among tea workers and the tea sector as a whole, a multi phased approach to ensure a sustainable intervention is required. This is intended to be the first phase of a multi-phase intervention, where an enabling eco-system for dialogue and mutual trust will be built with the various stakeholders. This approach is informed by our understanding that to achieve any sustainable change in the lives of tea workers, interventions will have to work at multiple levels of the worker communities, tea estate management as well as government. The projects aims to create win win Grant Application Form, July 1 201311situation for workers, Garden management and Government by addressing practical issues like livelihood enhancement of workers, bridging entitlement access gaps , demonstrating pilots for better living conditions in gardens through solutions for drinking water etc. An enabling eco-system that includes collaborative engagement will lead to improved and dignified quality of life of workers in the long run.  We intend to play a catalytic role through establishing a model which engages various stakeholders and is guided by our own strength and mission of shifting the power in trade. In the first phase 42 months, we propose to undertake entry point interventions with large tea estates (LTE) and closed tea gardens (CTG)), that will address the issues of:a) lacking skill & income enhancement opportunities for tea worker communities;b) Improve awareness and access to social entitlements through joint action between tea worker communities, tea garden management, government officials etc.c) Address solidarity and Cooperation through mobilizing women and youth in the Tea gardens for regular capacity building, information sharing and enhancing their role within the community;d) Pilot interventions to address Climate Change impacts in collaboration with Tea Research Association and other multistakeholder forums like Trustea/ Trinitea etc.e) Create informal platform of likeminded CSOs and representatives of Tea worker communities working in tea sector with a view to learn and promote good practices and strengthen sectoral understanding on the issues of Tea workers and Tea sector as a whole; andf) Build capacities of local partner organizations on facilitation skills, worker rights, skill trainings and migration so they can lead the change process in the future. In the subsequent phases, besides broadening its intervention to gardens, the work will build upon the stakeholder forums, community institutions and technical innovations developed during this phase.  Intensive and deepened work around working conditions and worker rights will be facilitated through constructive dialogue and consultations with the Tea estate managements and stakeholders forum. Simultaneously, issues of domestic violence against women, issues of trafficking and safe migration for youth will be addressed upfront by the empowered community institutions built in this phase. Using its experience in Consumer and brand engagement, Traidcraft will also work towards raising consumer awareness in domestic and international markets through campaigns and engage brands to adhere to transparency & ethical standards. Traidcraft will also leverage its experience gained in working with Large Tea estates to promote Sustainability standards by informing the Garden management on standards, facilitating them in adoption of practices to qualify for standards like Trustea/Trinitea for the domestic tea industry and ensuring their accountability through transparent self-disclosures. The informal network of CSOs and likeminded agencies, individuals, workers representatives etc. will be steered to evolve as a resource network for tea agencies/gardens and other CSOs to learn, ensure that tea workers voices are amplified, promote best practices and engage in facilitating programs and funding. Traidcrafts new portfolio approach to work on the issues of workers and Tea workers being one of the key programmatic focus, will enable its long-term commitment to the issue and bring in additional investment for future phases and programming.

        "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. Objectives (maximum 2,200 words)For a core support grant, state the purpose of this grant request and complete the objectives.  After consultations with an Oak PO, you may decide to summarise your mission as one broad objective. In this case, it is still necessary to specify activities and results/outcomes for this objective.For project support grants please list your objectives for this project in bullet point format. (You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. Under each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to achieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):Strengthened community groups of Women and Youth representing 9,000 tea worker households from 35 tea estates (Closed and Large Tea gardens; 10 in Assam and 25 in West Bengal) to access rights, schemes and entitlements through improved awareness, leadership and joint action           7.1.c. Objective 1 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Access to information and awareness of rights, government schemes and entitlements within the tea worker communities has been found to be quite poor, preventing many of the tea worker families to access the benefits of the schemes. Their awareness related to the workers rights has been also found to be quite low as only 9% of the tea workers working in the large tea estates responded that they were aware of laws protecting their rights. As a result, uptake on social security 7.1.b. Objective 1 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Key results achieved under this objective are:a. 246 Womens Groups and 35 Youth forums demonstrate enhanced confidence and leadership to access their rights and entitlements. About 60% households in Assam and West Bengal (6600 HHs) will be linked to minimum 1 Government programs or entitlements.b. Garden management, Panchayats and Government working together with the community groups to address the issues of access, quality & timeliness of entitlements     Grant Application Form, July 1 201313schemes, health and nutrition benefits is also low despite high levels of malnutrition and poor health of women and children, Even in the closed tea gardens where the District Administration takes over the management and facilitates these entitlements, most often lack of community demand and remoteness of the gardens, the workers are left out. On the other hand, underemployment and unemployment of youth are on the rise which leads to forced migration. Most people migrate to other cities and states through local agents who promise them of lucrative opportunities which quite often becomes a vicious trap of exploitation. The primary research threw light on many cases of trafficking that is on the rise. Cutting across these, is a deep sense of alienation and isolation of the community who are mostly tribal people with a colonial history of being uprooted from their original villages. Life in the tea gardens has not helped in integration with the mainstream people of the West Bengal and Assam. There is despondency and lack of agency which pushes them further to the margins. Hence, there is a need to collectivise and build on the community strength to exert their voice and improve awareness and knowledge on their rights and entitlements besides nurturing their sense of community and leadership.  The activities will be done through a participatory approach with engagement and handholding of women and youth to be able to lead their own pathway of change, expand their networks and articulate their needs. Following are the key foundational activities planned: 1.Mobilising Communities  Women groups and Youth Forums: At the outset of the project, mapping of the 10 selected tea gardens in Assam and 25 tea gardens in West Bengal to assess the status of the existing womens group formed in the past (as part of government initiatives) which now are either dysfunctional, inactive or weak will be undertaken.Alongside, youth in the tea gardens will also be mobilised and organised as youth forums. These Youth forums will provide an open space to youth to express themselves, build their skills and engage in welfare of their community members. Through mobilising support from expert agencies, Traidcraft will build capacities of partners in developing a structured approach to youth engagement,Depending on their social cohesion, the community will be organised as per their settlement pattern  for example in Assam the women groups will be organised based on their labour lines (this is how housing is defined on tea estates); whereas in West Bengal, women will be organised considering the size of the group (30 women per group). A total of 246 Womens Groups (200 in West Bengal, 46 in Assam) and 35 Youth forums (25 in West Bengal and 10 in Assam) will be formed in Year 1.2.Capacity Building and Awareness: Womens groups will be capacitated on livelihood activities, nutrition and health, social security schemes etc, Capacity building of youth groups entail building soft skills, cultural identity, youth and development, rights and entitlements, safe migration and career counselling.. In order to build networks, relevant resource agencies and government officials will be brought in to deliberate on the topic of their relevance. The activity will be undertaken both on Year 1 and Year 2 3.Facilitation for access to Entitlements: Community institutions i.e. Womens groups and Youth forums will be facilitated to support in accessing Grant Application Form, July 1 201314the various entitlements and schemes.  This would include mapping the households eligible for social security, health and nutrition and other relevant entitlements; assistance in registration, documentation etc. Community groups will also be supported to monitor the services of ICDS and Health centres and facilitated to liaise with the relevant authorities to access quality services. The project will also facilitate setting up a coordination committee at the block level engaging Panchayats and relevant government departments to facilitate the access of various schemes.  Schemes and entitlements that would be facilitated are: a. Pension schemes (example - National Old Age Pension, Widow Pension, Arunodoi - financial assistance to women - widow, differently abled, unmarried, divorcee); Student scholarship & Financial assistance for students/youths for studies and self-employment; skill development programs such as Swahid Dayal Das Panika Swaniyojan Achoni (specifically designed for the tea worker communities in Assam) etc.7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):3500 HHs (3000 HHs in West Bengal and 500 HHs in Assam) & 1500 youth (1000 in West Bengal and 500 in Assam) have increased resilience and choices through knowledge of improved practices, new skills, services and information thereby improving their livelihood and income opportunities7.2.c. Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):Our primary study reveals that the incidences of underemployment, seasonal unemployment & permanent unemployment are very high among tea workers & youth of the family. This is further aggravated by low wage rates, low levels of skills & lack of avenues for alternative employment. As per the study, on an average a permanent worker in a tea garden worker earns ? 44,000/- per annum with 271 working days; whereas a temporary worker in the garden earns ? 31,300/- per annum with 187 working days. Further, the study highlighted that 80% of the participants have been provided access to primary school for their children but access to the next stage of schooling is only 18% and under 5% report access to secondary and higher secondary schools. Thus, the tea workers & youth 7.2.b. Objective 2 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):a. 3500 Tea worker households have increased access to information, knowledge about improved farming and allied practices to diversify income. About 60% of the HHs will show 20-30% increase in their income1500 Youth from Tea worker community have increased opportunity for jobs or enterprise through improved knowledge and skills on specific market-oriented trade. About 50% of the trained youth who are placed/started their enterprise continue to work in the same vocation.    Grant Application Form, July 1 201315of the family (both male & female) often migrate to distant locations & engage in low paying unorganized sectors. Without informed choice many of them also fall prey to trafficking as this is seen as the only way out of this situation. Hence the creation of alternative livelihoods and the generation of supplementary income are key areas to intervene for sustenance of the families of tea workers.   The proposed action, both farm and farm allied income generating opportunities will be carried out with 3500 households (3000 HHs in West Bengal, 500 HHs in Assam). Simultaneously, 1500 youth (1000 in West Bengal and 500 in Assam) will be trained on vocational skills and provided with jobs and opportunity to be self-employed.       a.Farm and Farm allied income generation with 3500 Households: Livelihood planning for each household will be based on a participatory assessment and analysis of resources, skills, capacities of the Tea worker households. Our approach would entail optimum use of their homestead lands and increase in their productive assets, mostly around livestock. We understand that workers have no ownership rights on their dwellings or homestead lands, therefore interventions will be planned and carried out with active engagement of respective garden managements to mitigate the risks of unanticipated decisions of garden managements. Tea worker households will be able to utilise their resources optimally through inputs and trainings on improved and scientific practices, diversification and improved skills.. All this will be facilitated by creating local cadres of trained people who can continue to provide these services and knowledge to the local community. Key activities would include: i.Optimum utilisation of Homestead Lands: The project would facilitate promotion of multi-layered kitchen gardens meeting nutritional as well as income needs of the tea worker families. Model of kitchen gardens will be established considering the seasonal variation and will include Vegetables such as brinjal, leafy vegetables, tomatoes etc.; Creepers such as bottle gourd, pumpkin; and Spices such as coriander & garlic. This will ensure access to low-cost healthy diets throughout the year, save household expenses & also provide opportunity for additional income.  A total of 600 kitchen gardens will be promoted (150-200 kitchen gardens each year) during the project duration. (Ongoing-Year 1,2,3 & 4)ii.Improvement in Productive assets - Livestock: The project will also provide scientific technical trainings on backyard poultry, piggery (in Bengal only) and goatery which will help reduce the high mortality rate of the existing inventory of livestock & enable households to increase their overall HH income. This will be done through establishing both backward and forward linkages. Exposures and capacity building sessions by technical experts in Bengal & Assam will be carried out to develop a community cadre (30), which will essentially take care the necessary need of vet care services. Simultaneously, efforts will be made to collectivise and facilitate the collective sale through the existing womens group. Further convergence with line departments like animal resources departments, agriculture departments, horticulture departments, KVKs (Krishi Vigyan Kendras) will be made for ensuring scale & sustainability beyond the project. (Ongoing-Year 1,2,3 & 4)Black pepper plantation around Areca Nut Tree: Many of the Tea workers Grant Application Form, July 1 201316households have Areca nut Tree in their homestead land. Black Pepper is the most compatible perennial spice crop with areca nut and can be profitably grown. The project will promote Black pepper and help tea worker households to learn the basics of its management. It takes three years for the black pepper to fruit, and in this period the project will also undertake market assessments to help the Women groups market these produce at fair prices, thereby augmenting their incomes. b.Vocational Skills with 1500 Youth: Given that youth segment has an aspiration for other jobs beyond tea gardens, the project will work with youth (both Male and female) to help them with relevant employable and self-employable skills and assist them in getting jobs and/or start their own enterprise. Given the limited opportunities in the area, the project will make an assessment of the skills and trades in which youth are engaged when they migrate out of the state. Focussing on some of these trades will enable them to seek better wages at their destination locations. Youth who would want to set up/establish their own enterprise, targeted business and financial skills will also be imparted. Besides this, the project will also engage in building their self-esteem and leadership that are rooted in their cultural context and identity.         The proposed action is based on the interest and aspirations of the youth. Identification of vocational courses will be done based on assessment of their interests and willingness to pursue the same as their career choice as well as market demand. Relevant training and courses will be offered in collaboration with Government recognised skill training institutions or other institutions having specialised modules for selected trades. Post training, efforts will be made to link trained youth to placement companies for jobs in the mainstream market or to financial institutions for setting up small business. Key activities include: i.Needs and Skills assessment for prioritising vocational courses and enterprises for skill trainings and enterprise promotion (Year 1): The project will introduce a process of selection based on individual choices and interests of youth. For example  in West Bengal counselling and career guidance will help youth to take informed choices around the various offerings. At the same time, in Assam, an open discussion with the youth of the gardens and availability of local opportunities/offerings will help youth to share their willingness to join relevant courses. The project will also map some of the skill gaps highlighted from major employers which would also inform their choices in pursuing their career aspirations.ii.Enterprise development, Skill trainings on the identified vocational courses through Resource Organisations or Government sponsored trainings such as Skill Mission, Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) etc. (Y2: 500; Y3: 750; Y4: 250): Based on the skill gap and the choices shared by youth, the teams will organise the training offerings either through linking them with government run skill centres or resource organisations specialised in offering the courses. In Assam, an incubation centre will be set up for youth who wants to pursue the courses to set up their own enterprise. Besides technical training, additional trainings on Business and financial skills will also be imparted to them.  Few of the vocational courses to be imparted to youth (as highlighted during our study) are  Police, Driving, Hospitality, Chef, Motor Mechanic, Beautician, Sewing Grant Application Form, July 1 201317Operator etc.       iii.Counselling sessions, placement linkages and financial linkages through collaboration with placement agencies and financial institutions (Ongoing): The project will have a dedicated resource to work with various placement and employer companies to be able to support the trained youth in assuring their placements. Before the completion of the vocational courses, counselling sessions and softer skills to handle the changes in a new work environment, adjustments to the new place, dos and donts of working will be undertaken. Youth who are keen to set up their own enterprises will be either linked to Banks for seed capital or linked to government schemes such as MUDRA loan, Start Up India scheme, etc.7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):To establish model for improving productivity and mitigating risks of climate change through adoption of climate adaptive practices in two tea select gardens of West Bengal  7.3.c. Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):As per the research done by Tea Research Association, climate change is impacting the tea producers in a significant way, as tea is mainly grown under rain-fed mono-cropping systems and weather conditions determine optimal growth & quality of tea. The current trend of irregular nature of rainfall in the area, forces the growers to invest in irrigation facilities which also increases costs besides severe shortage of drinking water to the tea workers, who live on the gardens. Furthermore, declining productivity, increased incidences of pests and diseases compels the garden managements to use heavy doses of pesticides and chemicals having bearing on soil, the food safety standards & impacts severely on the health of the consumers and workers who are exposed to such chemicals. The study done by TRA assess that if this trend continues, large parts, where tea is grown currently will become unviable for commercial tea production in two to three decades.  7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):a. Results of the Innovations and climate adaptive practices shared widely with the other Tea Gardens/planters including government thereby improving visibility and demand from the other tea gardensb.   Garden management and workers in 2 tea gardens show enhanced understanding and adaptation to climate change practices, perceives reduced risks and costGrant Application Form, July 1 201318Hence, the project intends to demonstrate and pilot innovative adaptive measures and create models of best practices to be further promoted & replicated to other tea gardens.  The project will work with two tea gardens in West Bengal. These two gardens will be selected based on the level of cooperation extended by garden management and secondly on the extent of scarcity of drinking water in the gardens.The proposed activities related are: a.Water Recharging and harvesting measures: Since most of the tea gardens are located on undulating terrains, the runoff levels are high leading to drying up of natural springs which are the lifeline in the regions. One hectare of mature tea plants require 10,000 litres of water per day which is equivalent to 2.5mm rainfall. Tea plants also need water after pruning which is generally done during the months of Nov- Dec. This is the period when there is less rainfall resulting growers to invest in irrigation facilities. Therefore, interventions on recharging ground water, protecting catchments and reviving springs are critical and requires conjunctive interventions by tea management as well as government. Following pilots will be initiated:  oWater recharge through rainwater harvesting will be initiated in the gardens in convergence with the Government and garden management leveraging existing Government programmes. This would start with the development of a well recharge plan based on the principles of springshed management. A total of six such recharge structure (three each in 2 Tea Gardens) will be undertaken (Y1 and Y 3).    oTwo pilots on providing drinking water will be carried out. This will be a low cost and zero energy intensive model by diverting natural springs and using gravity, channelling the water to the households. Households will have potable water close to their homes which can be used for drinking and also for irrigation in their homesteads. This will be done in Year 2 and Year 3   b.Climate adaptive practices: In this area, the activities will include training Tea garden management and workers on good climate resilient practices and in situ management. Demonstrations in propagation of drought and stress tolerant cultivars, promotion of shade trees, intercropping, nutrient management through vermicompost, pest management etc. will be done in collaboration with the Garden management in the two gardens. This will enable the garden management to experiment and introduce new practices in the garden. Trainings will be carried out in collaboration with Tea Research Association (TRA) in Year 1 and Year 2. Additionally, in association with TRA or private companies, environmental stewardship training shall be conducted in the two gardens to reduce environmental load of agro- chemicals and also workers safety at workplace. A total of 2 such trainings will be done in Year 2 and Year 3.c.Sustainability Standards: There is a growing trend in consumer awareness and brands across all segments are working towards engaging with consumers to enhance transparency in sustainability practices adopted by them. Certification is usually done by third party agencies which is a means of providing assurance to the consumers on the sustainability standards adopted by the organisations. In association with certification agencies such as Trustea, Rainforest Alliance and others, the project will facilitate trainings for the two garden managements on standards for Grant Application Form, July 1 201319certification and also expose the garden management to other gardens who have implemented these standards. The project will encourage the garden managements in developing an implementation plan to meet the standards for certification and also assist them in case of further need. This activity will be initiated in Year 2 and carried on in Year 3. The project will facilitate the tea gardens to adopt the best practices as per the sustainability standards, however, the garden management will bear the cost of certification.  Documentation and development of IEC: The project will document and understand the results of the various innovations and best practices adopted by the tea gardens. Appropriate IEC and communication materials will be developed and shared widely with various platforms and importantly across the gardens of intervention. Longitudinal study will be carried out on an annual basis to be able to understand the changes, inform and develop the IEC and communication materials7.4.a. Objective 4 (maximum one sentence):Informal Forum of Civil Society Organisations constructively engage for giving greater voice and visibility to the conditions of tea worker community through collective action and advocacy.7.4.c. Objective 4 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):The baseline research highlighted the multidimensional nature of vulnerability and issues of Tea worker communities across gender, age and social factors. Several CSOs, national and international organisations have worked towards addressing some of these problems. With the changing context and policy regime affecting the tea industry, there is a constant need to learn and share knowledge, practices and create an enabling platform for cooperation and collaboration amongst various organisations working on Tea worker issues in particular and Tea sector in general. The new labour code that is expected to replace the Plantation Labour Act 1951 offers an important opportunity for broad based understanding and wide dissemination of the labour Code. There is scope for like-minded organisations to come together as a support for Tea workers using their collective strength, experience and influencing powers. This will provide greater visibility to the nearly 7.4.b. Objective 4 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 words):a. CSO forum identifies at least two policy areas affecting tea workers and undertake joined up action as per the advocacy plan  b. Communication materials on new labour Code allows for easier and broad based understanding of the provisions for all stakeholders including garden management and tea workersGrant Application Form, July 1 201320invisible workers of the most popular beverage of the country Traidcraft has past experience of successfully carrying out campaigns, research and advocating for policies regarding small tea growers and issues pertaining to Assam Tea workers. Building on this experience, Traidcraft India along with its experts from the Policy team at Traidcraft UK would facilitate and steer the informal forum of CSOs for peer to peer learning, sharing practices, capacity building, issue based work and policy advocacy. The following activities will be done under this objective: a.Setting up the forum and joint agenda setting: The project will map relevant CSOs, understand their expertise and assess their interest in working with the Tea workers. In the Year 1 of the project, it would organise meeting with the CSOs that show their interest and co-create its agenda and set policy goals. The informal CSO forum will work on creating awareness on identified topics through print media, social media and policy briefs. One of the key agenda for the group would be to work on the Labour Code which replaces the Plantation Labour act. Specifically, the work would be around simplified understanding of the key aspects of the new Labour Code, translations in local language and wider dissemination through workshops and round tables. Other areas identified at this stage are to map gaps in specific State level rules post transposition of Central level Labour Code which affect Tea workers adversely. Mapping of these gaps would lead to identification of Policy asks and strategize accordingly.b.Issue Based Workshops and Round tables: Periodically, Traidcraft would facilitate knowledge sharing through issue-based workshops and round tables for shared understanding on specific issues - for e.g. workers rights, new labour code, women and violence, trafficking etc. Four round tables and issue-based learning sessions over Year 2 and Year 3 would be organised. This would also help strengthen capacities of the CSO partners of the forum besides developing collective strategy and joined up action to address the various issues of the Tea workers, both in West Bengal and Assam. This would be complemented by Policy Advocacy team at UK taking up an assessment of business performance of Tea companies to assess the overall viability of the companies and scope to invest for welfare of workers. Insights from this study will feed into advocacy strategy at UK and India level in the next phase.Communication and Dissemination event: Working paper, discussions from the round table, communication materials on the new labour code, learnings from the project, results from the longitudinal study etc. will form some of the key documents and knowledge product of the project. Communication material in form of audio visual would also be developed for creating visibility on the of issues of tea worker communities. The same will be disseminated as part of the National level dissemination event and other forums, that will be organised in the Year 4.  Grant Application Form, July 1 201321",
        "8. COOPERATION": "8. CooperationDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks and explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 words):Traidcraft Exchange will work closely with local partners Prasari in West Bengal and Pajhra in Assam in a spirit of co-implementors with Partners driving the work on the ground, and Traidcraft providing the technical support, and amplifying tea workers voices by convening forums and use of social media. Both CSOs have been working in the region and have good relationships with the tea communities. Traidcraft will work with its India counterpart - Traidcraft Services Private Limited (TSIPL)  a wholly owned subsidiary of Traidcraft Exchange. TSIPL is a social enterprise working towards trade justice and climate justice. TSIPL supports fair trade and responsible business practices that benefit workers and producers and offer strategic advisory and consulting services that are backed with the capacity to support on-ground implementation across Indias diverse geographies. Besides managing the overall program, Traidcraft (TSIPL) will specifically lead the work on Climate adaptive practices (objective 3) in collaboration with Tea Research Association, Tea Garden management and on ground support from Prasari. Simultaneously, Traidcraft including the Traidcraft Exchange policy unit in UK will lead in setting up and coordination of the informal CSO group (Objective 4). Parallelly, the Traidcraft team will also support both Prasari and Pajhra in market linkages and help trained youth find jobs in Companies, build linkages with placement agencies and help set up robust collective enterprises (Objective 2). Importantly, the projects learning will be facilitated through annual planning and reflection workshops, enabling both Prasari and Pajhra synergies their on-ground actions for future.                             PRASARI, established in 2007, works specifically in the areas of water security, diversion-based irrigation to augment the water, and income and nutritional security of the rural households. It works through establishing multi-tiered women-led institutions which are the building blocks to execute any programme. They are active in the Dooars region (Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar) of West Bengal and have successfully piloted diversion-based irrigation projects in collaboration with the government and other philanthropic donors. Prasari will implement the project across 25 tea gardens across Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Darjeeling. Specific role of Prasari in this project includes: a) establishing robust women and youth forum in all the 25 Tea Gardens in West Bengal; b) work closely with government and Tea garden management in linking up with various social entitlement schemes including nutrition, drinking water, enterprise development etc.; c) establishing farm based livelihoods to 3000 households and counselling and ensuring skill training of 1000 youth; and d) undertake innovative pilots around spring shed, well recharge and diversion based drinking water. While they have been working specifically with women primarily looking at water, livelihoods and nutritional security, working with youth and using a rights perspective from the workers point of view would be a newer area for them. The project will support building their capacities by bringing experts working on youth mobilisation and development. Exposure to Assam and Pajhra will inform their orientation on youth mobilisation as well as build their workers rights perspective. Traidcraft will also help them in bringing in a market perspective for some of the on-farm and off-farm livelihoods besides building linkages and networks for the placement of skilled youth in urban areas.                  Grant Application Form, July 1 201322PAJHRA was established in November 2001 by a group of Adivasi social activists and leaders. It works towards building capabilities of the Adivasi community to access their entitlements, improve their socio-economic status in the society and their wellbeing, and promoting social integration of Adivasis from all walks of life in Assam. Pajhra will implement the project across 10 tea gardens across Biswanath and Sonitpur districts in Assam. In this project, Pajhra will specifically lead on: a) establishing robust women and youth forum in all the 10 Tea Gardens in Assam; b) working closely with government and Tea garden management in linking up with various social entitlement schemes including nutrition, drinking water, youth scholarship, enterprise development etc.; c) establishing farm based livelihoods to 500 households and counselling and ensuring skill training of 500 youth. In addition to this, Pajhra will also bring its knowledge on the issue of Tea workers and build perspective around wage and living wage within the CSO group.  Pajhra has been working with tea workers, which are primarily Adivasis, and have been actively developing youth and women leaders within the community. Skill building, enterprise development for youth and climate adaptive practices will be a newer area of work for them. Traidcraft will mentor Pajhras implementation team in ensuring business and market linkage support. At the same time, engagement with TRA and exposure to Prasaris project area will build their perspective on climate adaptive practices.  Another area of cooperation and support sought by both organisations is in the area of Organisational Development. Pajhra has expressed their need for reviewing their organisational work and identify areas that require improvement or strengthening. Based on the review, Pajhra would also be open to consider a possible restructuring. This has been also mandated by their Board and would have full support from their leadership team. Prasari, who has recently undergone an Organisational Review Exercise and is already implementing the recommendations, is keen to develop inhouse capacities within management team to take up Organisational Development (OD) and Learning in future. They would like to invest in capacity building of management team members on OD processes. Apart from these two field partner CSOs, the program will also engage other stakeholders and agencies, primarily towards achieving its objective for piloting climate adaptive practices & sustainability standards in the tea gardens and establishing an informal CSO group working for the welfare of tea workers both at regional and national level. Traidcraft will spearhead both the partnership and leading the thematic area, given its own capability and knowledge in the tea sector and understanding of the system of managing and implementing standards.For climate adaptive practices, we would partner with the Tea Research Association (TRA)  which has been set up principally to improve the overall productivity and quality of the tea. It is a pioneer and innovator in tea research and provides extension services to the tea industry. We are already in discussion with TRA HQ in Kolkata and they have their field offices both at Jorhat (Assam) and Jalpaiguri (West Bengal). In relation to improving and promoting sustainability standards (both climate as well as worker friendly) in the tea gardens where we would work, we will engage with multi stakeholder initiatives such as Trustea (an Indian sustainability code and verification system for the tea sector working with smallholder tea growers, bought leaf factories, estates and packers to address some of the key challenges in the industry including working conditions, health and safety of tea workers, water pollution, food safety, soil erosion and contamination) and/or Trinitea (an Indian initiative to transform the tea smallholder segment in India while taking care of the social and environmental issues).Grant Application Form, July 1 201323    For initiating the informal CSO group, we will partner with a number of like-minded CSOs and MSIs that are active in working for the welfare of tea workers and the tea sector overall. Organisations like Oxfam, Nazdeek, UNWomen, Unicef, Solidaridad and many more will be contacted to be a part of this initiative. We have discussed the idea with Oxfam, and they have shown a very positive response on the same.       In addition to this, expert organisations working on the issues of youth, skill building, leadership and domestic violence will be roped in as resource agencies to be able to support the partners capacity development.",
        "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. ImpactWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum 300 words):In this phase, the project will be able to build the foundation of stronger and empowered tea community across 35 tea Gardens. Besides this, an enabling environment and engagement model between tea garden management, tea communities, government and CSOs will be strengthened. Successful models of climate adaptive practices will be tested and will be ready to be scaled to other tea gardens. At the end of the project, following expected impacts are envisaged:The following changes are envisaged at the end of four year: Strengthened community groups and forums working with the Garden Management, Panchayats and Government officials to improve the delivery of various services and entitlements. Improved choices and alternative options of Tea worker communities through diversified livelihoods, skills and knowledge. Around 60% of participating households (3500) have increased income of 15-30% (baseline survey and Annual monitoring on sample basis)Tea worker communities especially youth experience a general improvement in their status and are able to articulate the changes in their personality, attitudes, behaviour and sense of social responsibility which are evident in the initiatives taken by them. (Case studies)Visibility from the success of the Climate resilient production and management practices within Tea Gardens serve as lessons for further scale up as reflected through enhanced demand from other Tea Gardens.Civil Society forum builds on their collective strength to formulate a common strategic framework of work to support Tea workers and the sectorLocal partners feel empowered and capacitated to address the issues of Tea workers and gain credibility with various stakeholders- especially Garden management and Government agencies and the community at large.Grant Application Form, July 1 201324 10. EvaluationHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):Our commitment to understanding the impact of our programmes and driving continued learning and improving, requires that we utilize robust M&E methods, systems and tools. Following mechanisms will be put in place to assess the progress, monitor and evaluate the success of the project; a. Participatory approach to MEL: Traidcraft Exchange will adopt a participatory approach for monitoring the progress of the project. This will be determined by the local communities identification of the metrics of their progress based on the ground situation and the baseline. Supporting project participants to themselves determine their metrics will enable a process of empowerment of local workers in the tea estate which will strengthen their sense of agency and also increase their mutual collaboration for collective benefit. Traidcraft has experience to support local collectives on participatory monitoring of their own development and will guide the process in the duration of the project. In addition to this, engaging selected beneficiaries for longitudinal case studies which is a more qualitative approach to capture changes in their lives over a period of time, will be undertaken by the project. Such studies supported by case studies will capture degree of change in confidence and leadership abilities of the target group. This will include improvement in livelihoods, agency and aspirations, access to entitlements etc. b. Logical Framework Analysis (LFA) based progress assessment: Complementing the above participatory approach to MEL, the project will have a clear set of indicators for each outcome and output area outlined above based on the LFA framework. Development of the LFA and monitoring framework at the outset of the initiation of the project will be carried out in collaboration with the on-ground partners  viz. Prasari and Pajhra. This will be guided by a detailed baseline that will be done in the first year of the project.  Data will be collected against the set indicators for the above-mentioned Outcome areas. Specifically, data on current levels of production in the two pilot gardens, availability and accessibility of drinking water, sources of water and cultivation practices will be collected in baseline and mapped annually to understand the changes on these parameters as well as adoption of recommended practices on environment and safety measures.  A dynamic excel based project MIS will be developed to capture the data and track the progress.   Grant Application Form, July 1 201325c. Ongoing Monitoring and Learning: Traidcraft India will manage all M&E activities with support from our UK-based Quality & Impact Lead. Monthly review meetings with partners will be done as part of planning and monitoring. External members of Traidcraft will join quarterly meetings which will be documented through quarterly reports and meeting minutes. These meetings will provide opportunities for the project team to reflect on progress, learning and implications for adaptive programming. In addition, the project will also organise annual partners meet for reflections and planning for the upcoming year. These annual reflection exercises are facilitated to capture individual and collective learnings on the project, that are essential for future planning. In addition, it helps in identifying shortcomings and build common strategy to address as a group. Annual Narrative and Financial Reports will be prepared that will be shared with Oak Foundation on a periodic basis. d. Mid term and Endline Evaluation: A mid-term evaluation will be done by the second year end for reviewing progress and learning based on which recommendations will be incorporated. Mid term assessment typically involves assessment of the progress, more importantly capturing the key learnings and assessment of any mid-term course correction requirement in the project. It is carried out by Traidcraft team members who are not directly associated with the project management or implementation. A final evaluation will be conducted by the project end using mixed methodology (both qualitative and quantitative tools with participatory approaches) to assess the projects impact and learning including progress against all indicators, outcomes and objectives. It is especially important as proposed work is a multi-phase programme, where the learnings from the endline evaluation will contribute to the design of the next phase.",
        "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future PlansHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum Grant Application Form, July 1 201326300 words):Traidcraft is keen to work to resolve issues of tea workers and so this is a long term partnership. Along with our local partners we will support interventions to improve the livelihoods of the tea worker communities and help in developing sustainable models for income diversification while imparting new skills and knowledge. Based on this, there is significant scope of expanding these initiatives in similar geographies with similar issues. The grant will also demonstrate multipronged intervention models based on an assessment of skills, resources, capabilities and aspirations of the community of tea workers. While Traidcraft has already gained an understanding of multidimensional vulnerability in the lives of tea worker communities, the interventions require a long-term engagement with the community. Having suffered from such issues across generations, there is a sense of hopelessness and erosion of agency. Therefore, it is imperative that interventions build incremental improvement and thereby confidence to exert their agency. Thus the intervention design will span multi-phase interventions, of which the current phase is primarily the entry point, aimed at establishing rapport and confidence as well as an enabling environment to piggy back other interventions addressing issues of rights, working conditions, migration, trafficking, violence and climate change. In this, there is opportunity to scale operations in other geographies in the north east as well as other tea growing regions. Traidcraft UK, through its previous interventions with global brands, has significant experience of creating transparency in sourcing tea and also raising consumer awareness regarding issues on the ground. A long-term model for domestic area can be designed to raise consumer awareness regarding the issues faced by workers and engaging local brands and other stakeholders in promoting more transparent ways of operating. This will create a new wave in consumer awareness and brand engagement in the country which has one of the highest tea consuming population. Traidcraft also will take a lead role to create a multi-stakeholder platform for the issues in the tea sector. This platform will have civil society organisations, donor agencies, local activists and government representatives who will work towards improving policy and action taking into account the voices of the affected people. We envisage that such a platform will provide Traidcraft the opportunity to highlight the issues of the tea worker community and create an enabling environment overall. Given that climate change has a significant impact on productivity in the tea sector Traidcraft, through this project will rope in other stakeholders like the Tea Research Association etc. to provide the needed inputs and knowledge on better management practices suitable to changing climatic conditions which will provide useful directions to other tea estate managements in the regions. Traidcraft will actively disseminate these learnings amongst a wide audience so that there is greater awareness on the issues of tea.  This will enable a more equitable playing field for various actors engaged in the tea industry, especially the tea estate workers who constitute the weakest link in the chain.Grant Application Form, July 1 201327",

MHT is working in 34 cities across 9 states in India on three major domains: Habitat Development, Climate Resilience and Participatory Governance. Over the last 28 years, MHT has made a significant impact in improving the lives of urban poor across 1126 slum settlements and currently has in place 983 Community Action Groups (CAGs) consisting of 11-15 members each who are grass-root women leaders in those slum communities. MHT thus possess a strong social capital of 15,954 grass-root leaders serving as amplifiers in the slum communities. They further come together as a peer group   Oak Application Form     5 of informed and articulate citizens to participate in shaping urban policies, including those, on climate change. We also work in Nepal and Bangladesh, through our partners.  MHT prides itself in the fact, that, it is a grass roots technical organization. It is also a Gandhian organization. Our staffing consists of professionals like engineers, architects and urban planners to grassroots women leaders, in an equal proportion. Additionally we also have what we call spearhead teams, who are women from the community itself who work on an honorarium with us. We have 150+  fulltime staff/consultants and offices across eight states in India More than 80 percent of our staff is women and all programmes are women led.  Our Governance constitutes of nine members on our Board of Trustees, of which two are men and rest are women, making us a women led organization. Three women members in a board of nine(33%) are from the minority community and including backward classes in India. Two members of the three as mentioned above are also from the grassroots, (the rest being professionals). The grassroots board members, largely perform  the roles of watch dog to safe guard and speakup for the rights of  the poor women and ensure that MHT adheres to its vision and mission. Over the past two years we have been specially focusing on developing the leadership of tribal and muslim women through our programmes and have a geographical focus on regions which has a larger population of these two communities in particular. Again since our work enables poor women, to execute their right in for basic services, land, housing,  sanitation water and clim ate change,  we are also focusing for the next few years to build the leadership of adolescent girls in these focus areas.    5b.

(600 words): Context Informal workers form the mainstay of the Indian economy. Informal workers in Kolkatas slum settlements face numerous challenges. Economically, they endure unstable incomes, lack social security, and are often exploited. Housing is overcrowded and poorly constructed. Health issues are rampant due to unsanitary conditions, limited healthcare access, and poor nutrition. Educational opportunities are scarce, with many children forced into labor. Environmental hazards, such as pollution and vulnerability to natural disasters, exacerbate their living conditions. Basic infrastructure, including clean water, electricity, and proper sewage systems, is often inadequate.  The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area in the Indian state of West Bengal, centred around the city of Kolkata (also known as Calcutta). It is the largest urban agglomeration in the eastern part of India and the third largest in the country, housing over 14.85 million people, as of the 2011 census. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is comprised of the city of Kolkata, its suburbs, several neighbouring towns (including 4 municipal corporations, and 27 municipalities) and adjoining rural areas. It is the economic, cultural, and educational hub of eastern India and hosts several major commercial and industrial centres, making it one of the most important economic zones in India.[3] Informal workers like street vendors, domestic workers, construction workers and waste pickers are expected to be around 20 - 25 lakh (over 2 million) in a similar situation as other parts of the country, without much social security and living in the margins of the current developmental discourse. The KMA also has a large informal sector that employs a significant number of migrant workers, particularly in construction, domestic work, and small-scale industries. These workers face compounded challenges such as low wages, long working hours, and poor working conditions. Many of them live in makeshift housing and lack access to basic amenities like clean water, sanitation, and health care. Migrant workers face social challenges, such as discrimination, isolation, and limited access to education and health services. It is estimated that around 50% of the informal workers (1 million) are migrants, with an equal percentage from other districts of Bengal and migrants from other states like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Assam. An equal or similar share of outmigration is reported as well.[4] The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is also located precariously. Like many other coastal cities in the world, is facing a range of impacts from climate change and is listed in the top eight megacities to be first impacted by climate change. The city is in the deltaic region of eastern India, which makes it vulnerable to sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and heat waves.[5] The changing climate is leading to an increased risk of coastal flooding and erosion, as well as water scarcity, particularly during the dry season. The city's infrastructure and public services, including transportation, energy, and water systems, are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which can strain these systems and result in economic losses. In addition to the physical impacts, the changing climate also has social and economic impacts on the people of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. The most impacted areas overlapping directly with the informal worker settlements in the region are vulnerable to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased poverty because of climate change.   Oak Application Form     7 To address these challenges, the government in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, led by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are taking steps to increase the region's resilience to climate change. This includes implementing flood control measures, improving disaster preparedness and response, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and preparing climate action plans for their cities.[6][7] The major concern in the slew of positively directed actions is that informal workers, their live-work settlements and their livelihoods as of now are not a major focus area of the climate resilience actions pushed by the state and authorities. Thereby ignoring the most vulnerable, impacted informal workers from the climate resilience action plans for the region. Also straight-jacketed approaches of focusing on the urban infrastructure building, without focusing on capacities and linkages ignoring migration from climate-impacted rural regions is another gap amongst many in the climate resilience actions. This approach requires a change: in perspective and in action.  That is what this intervention sets to achieve  CHANGE that is for and led by the empowerment of the most vulnerable informal worker communities. [1] In India, informal workers are those individuals who work in unorganized sectors and are not covered by labour laws or social security measures. This segment of the workforce includes self-employed individuals, casual labourers, street vendors, domestic workers, and other unorganized sector workers. [2] The labour codes in India refer to a set of laws and regulations that govern various aspects of employment, including wages, working conditions, social security, and industrial relations. In 2020, the Indian government introduced four new labour codes, namely, the Code on Wages, the Industrial Relations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, and the Social Security Code.

The process of enabling women leaders through Community Action Groups for climate resilience and to access benefits of social security schemes will be implemented with following activities. i. Community Mobilization: In the challenging and often marginalized environments of urban settlement in both ULB, community mobilization plays a pivotal role in initiating and sustaining positive change. MHT will deploy diverse methods such as folk media, community meetings and video screenings to engage residents based on their local context and acceptance. The overarching goal is to raise awareness about the organization and project details while establishing a strong rapport with the community. This approach ensures active community participation and a sense of ownership over the projects.   ii. Research study  Baseline study on social security: In the inception stage of the project (1st quarter) household level social security survey will be carried out in 30 project slums. Survey will be conducted with below given objectives: Assess Accessibility and Awareness:  Objective: To evaluate the current level of accessibility to and awareness of existing social security schemes among households in the project slums.   Oak Application Form     10  Rationale: Understanding the baseline accessibility and awareness will help identify gaps and barriers preventing households from fully benefiting from these schemes. Identify Needs and Preferences:  Objective: To identify the specific social security needs of households and their preferred methods for receiving services.  Rationale: Gathering information on households' needs and preferences will enable the project to tailor interventions and recommendations to better meet the community's requirements. Evaluate Willingness to Pay:  Objective: To determine the willingness of households to pay for social security services and their expectations regarding service delivery.  Rationale: Understanding the financial willingness and expectations of households will inform the design and implementation of sustainable social protection schemes that are both affordable and acceptable to the community. iii. Landscape study- integration of climate resilience in existing policy: To enhance climate resilience for the urban poor and informal sector workers, we propose conducting a comprehensive landscape study of existing state and local government policies and programs. This intervention will involve a detailed analysis of current policy frameworks to assess the extent to which climate change considerations are integrated. By identifying gaps and opportunities, we aim to pinpoint strategic entry points for strengthening climate resilience measures within social security programs. This approach will enable us to develop targeted recommendations for policy enhancements that not only address immediate social security needs but also build long-term resilience against climate-related vulnerabilities, ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth for the most marginalized populations. iv.  Formation and Trainings of CAGs : It is increasingly accepted that the social capital of communities can contribute to beneficial economic and social outcomes in urban development. MHT believes that if the grassroots collectives of women are provided with the requisite knowledge, technology and skills to identify and assess development issues, they will be able to constructively engage with governance and planning processes to lead transformation in their own communities. Based on this philosophy, MHT will organise and train women leaders from urban poor communities across city. These women leaders will undergo extensive training on various subject like collective leadership, government structure, map sharing & participation, formation of slum development plan, climate change etc. These women leaders will then lead project activities in urban poor settlements across both ULB. They will play pivotal role in connecting urban poor communities with city government, elected representative and other stakeholders. Following Training modules will be followed to build capacity of CAGs Sr. No Training  Objective Days Participants   Oak Application Form     11 1 CBO/ CAG Formation Need of CAG, Importance of CAG, Process formation of CAG, role of CAG, role of CAG leaders, focus on women led CAG.  2 20 2 Structure and functioning of urban local bodies (ULB) & Awareness on social security schemes  To enhance community understanding of different departments & authority of ULB. create awareness on social security schemes, empowering participants to access benefits and actively engage in community action groups, fostering collective efforts towards social welfare and economic stability. 2 20 3 Basic Climate Change Raise awareness about basic climate change.

Identification of new eligible beneficiaries if any by CAGs  Completion of application form and collection of required supporting documents by CAGs & MHT field staff  Submission of application form to relevant government department by CAG member & MHT field staff  Follow-up with government department for timely processing of the application by CAG members and MHT field staff  CAGs to keep beneficiary informed regarding their application status  CAG & MHT field staff to keep record of successful application and availed benefits  vi. Conduct Climate Vulnerability Assessment  Community-based Vulnerability Assessment is being done with special toolkit which is a set of seven participatory tools, which aimed to create an understanding among the community about climate change and its varied impacts. The purpose of this exercise is to create a understanding in terms of climate change. The first stage of the exercise is the realise stage, where the purpose is to inculcate a understanding where the community starts to envision the harmful weather effects that they are facing with climate change. The second stage is the Analyse stage, where community starts to interlink the effects and initiate a thought process from systems thinking approach. The third stage contains visualization of effects with respect to their areas. In the last stage, based upon the previous processes where risks were identified, community will synthesis a resilience plan.  vii. Develop Climate Resilience Action Plan : Based on the vulnerability assessment, the leaders will be trained to make action plan. CAGs along with other active members from settlement will prioritize activities, timeline, budget to accomplish the activities.    viii. Implementation of Climate Resilience Action Plan  Based on the settlement climate resilience plan, Community Action Groups (CAGs) and other active settlement members will take the lead in implementing the plan. MHT will play a pivotal role by demonstrating key activities in selected settlements to inspire and encourage leaders to mobilize resources effectively. This hands-on approach will provide a practical framework, showcasing successful strategies and fostering confidence among leaders to prioritize activities, establish realistic timelines, and allocate necessary budgets. Through this collaborative effort, the community will be better equipped to enhance its resilience against climate-related challenges, ensuring a more sustainable and secure future.   Oak Application Form     13  ix. Provide technical assistance to social enterprise to make livelihood climate resilience  Providing technical assistance to social enterprises of urban informal workers to enhance climate resilience involves several steps. Trainings awareness will be offered on climate-smart practices, such as sustainable waste management, energy-efficient technologies, and climate-resilient livelihood, accessing marketing support, finance etc. Collaborate with local government and service providers to create support networks. Networking support will empower informal workers to sustain their livelihoods amidst climate challenges.  x. Demonstration of climate resilience Solution : Based on priority, need, and vulnerability assessments, climate resilience solutions for various climate stresses, including heat and flooding, will be planned. MHT's extensive experience in heat and flooding resilience technologies will be leveraged, incorporating solutions such as solar reflective white paints, net zero cooling stations, and vector-borne disease control drives. These interventions will be strategically implemented to address specific vulnerabilities, ensuring the community is better equipped to withstand and adapt to climate challenges. MHT's expertise will guide the community in adopting effective, sustainable practices to enhance overall resilience and improve living conditions.

(300 words):  Founded in 2004, Kolkata Sanved (KS) is a women -led pioneer organization in the field of Dance Movement Therapy (DMT), promoting holistic well -being and quality life enhancement. KS has contributed to gender equality, mental health and well -being by working for empowerment of marginalized individuals (children, adolescent girls, youth & women) using DMT and other creative arts.  In the 1990s, Sohini Chakraborty began experimenting  with DMT to complement the traditional rehabilitation process with the residents of an NGO -run shelter home in Kolkata. The initiative grew into a full -blown project and finally culminated in the establishment of Kolkata Sanved in 2004 to serve as a platf orm for using DMT in psychosocial rehabilitation.  Sohini was awarded the Ashoka Fellowship for her   Oak Application Form8 innovative and unique idea that incorporated creative therapies within traditional rehabilitation programmes, and more importantly: in building capacity with in the participants to become DMT practitioners themselves, able to earn a living as well as live a life of dignity and respect.    KSs culturally contextual model Sampoornata (meaning fulfilment) focuses on holistic well-being and bringing about a cha nge within. This includes physical, emotional, mental, spiritual and social aspects. The model focuses on psycho -social rehabilitation of survivors of violence & marginalization, prevention of violence & promotion of mental health. The hallmark of Sampoornata is to create DMT practitioners, leaders and change-makers from grassroots. 60% of KS core employees are from marginalized communities with representations in primary constituents, Board & Senior Leadership Team.   KS has broken new grounds by taking i ts work to various non -profits, marginalized communities, mainstream schools, NGO &Govt.  run care institutions, mental hospitals etc.by collaborating with 60+ organizations and government departments across South Asia. Working with diverse population, KS has expanded its reach to seven states.The establishment of the Dance Movement Therapy Leadership Development Academy (DMTLDA) signifies a structured approach to facilitate the growth of DMT practitioners from underprivileged communities. 130+ such individ uals have developed skills to become DMT practitioners & change -makers with recognition of 10+ such DMT practitioners at the national and international level. Along with this, KS, in partnership with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, offers a Post Graduate Diploma program in DMT. This significant milestone places DMT within the realm of academic rigor and formal recognition, contributing to the creation of a new discipline and profession with 200+graduates.Over the years, KS has established a strong collaboration with the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare, Government of West Bengal &Maharashtra. Kolkata Sanved was featured in an international documentary film called \"Little Stones,\" with over 70 screenings globally. KS's work was showcased on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). The Kolkata Sanved Sampoornata model was published as a book by Routledge - Taylor and Francis Group. To date, Kolkata Sanved has served 65,000+ members of marginalized communities and connected with 200,000+ citizens.    KSs V ision is to form a healthy, violence -free, gender -equal, creative society of empowered individuals.   Our Mission is to enhance gender equality and improve mental health and wellbeing of individuals and communities by building an ecosystem for DMT for social development. We strive to create DMT practitioners, leaders and change -makers in the field from vulnerable & un derprivileged communities by establishing a Centre for Creative Wellbeing and Social Change.   5f. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? How will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and decide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if you are influenced by research, policy or your own organisations experience, please tell us about this. Have you consulted with relevant   Oak Application Form9 stakeholders, including your communities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address equity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):  India is home to the world's largest youth population, totalling over 808 million individuals, constituting around 66% of the overall populace. The mental health and well -being of adolescents and young adults are pivotal for comprehensive development. Give n that a significant portion of mental health conditions emerges by the mid -twenties, a systematic approach to addressing youth mental health is imperative. India, with a youth demographic of over 250 million aged 15 24, grapples with unique challenges suc h as academic pressure, interpersonal relationships, vocational concerns, and discrimination based on caste, social status, and gender norms. The National Mental Health Survey for India discloses alarmingly high suicide rates, standing at 17.1 per 100,000 among young adults and 9.52 per 100,000 among adolescents. The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated existing challenges, leading to increased stress, depression, anxiety, post -traumatic stress, substance abuse, and suicides among young people. The pandemic widene d existing inequities, disproportionately affecting those in poor communities, who face additional barriers in accessing resources for health, education and social welfare.  Despite being viewed as the energetic force shaping society's future, the youth ar e susceptible to various challenges and vulnerabilities. These encompass engaging in high -risk behaviours exposing them to criminal activities, accidents, physical injuries, emotional distress, and various health issues. Limited employment options, restric ted access to information, and economic displacement have a lasting psycho-social impact on children, youth, and their families, particularly concerning mental health. This impact manifests in feelings of isolation, identity struggles, and a prevailing sense of hopelessness. The youth in North Bengal's tea gardens face multifaceted challenges that hinder their growth, development, and wellbeing. These challenges stem from the historical context of the tea industry's crisis, economic disparities, and lack of  access to education and opportunities. Although tea estate employees constitute a substantial workforce, their socio-economic conditions remain deplorable. Within this context, the youth in tea gardens confront an array of challenges, including severely limited access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, fostering a pervasive sense of hopelessness and disempowerment. Many youths and teenagers in these areas struggle for survival, with educational opportunities remaining distant dreams for most. Children and youth often fall victim to trafficking for labour and other forms of exploitation, exacerbating their challenges. Sustained psycho -social support interventions are essential to empower the youth, enhance their mental and emotio nal resilience, and provide them with opportunities for a brighter future.  Our approach involves engaging youth groups and key stakeholders through Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) sessions, ensuring a participatory process that incorporates their voices and perspectives into the design of future interventions. In accordance with the Kolkata Sanved model, the process for establishing the demand for mental well-being interventions follows a strategic sequence. Initially, our model operates in collaboration with  existing organizations in the region and the target community, leveraging established networks and resources. Secondly, a community network is cultivated, providing orientation to individuals on the benefits of mental well-being to raise awareness and pro mote understanding within the community. The intervention itself   Oak Application Form10 incorporates a unique feature, offering participants the opportunity to undergo training as Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) practitioners and change-makers. This approach not only enhances the s kills and knowledge of community members but also empowers them to actively contribute to mental well -being initiatives. A pivotal role is played by the youth leader who, having undergone training becomes an ambassador through this process, and conducts well-being sessions within the community. This individual effectively bridges the gap, meeting the demand for mental well-being interventions at the grassroots level.   6.

If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a work plan. Examples might include: o Research  o Provision of legal advice to... o Trainings on movement building for...  Phase 1: Formative Research and piloting DMT session: 18 months   In the first half of the project, our primary focus will be on conducting a thorough Needs Assessment and Situational Analysis. This step is pivotal for understanding the unique challenges and aspirations of the local youth, communities, and stakeholders within North Bengal in relation to mental health and well -being. This phase will involve multiple crucial activities including a pilot of DMT sessions within the new region. To start off with, Kolkata Sanved will conduct an orientation on the program with all the concerned stakeholders.  The broad activities will include:   Preparation: Project team formation, partner identification, stakeholder mapping, location identification  Situational analysis and assessment: Research design and methodology, data collection, DMT sessions with the youth, data analysis  Community engagement  through DMT, DMT based workshops with youth and stakeholders  Developing Final Module and Intervention Plan: Dissemination with local stakeholders  Monitoring & Documentation In this participatory research methodology, the tools that will be used for data c ollection are a combination of the following, which includes survey, Focused Group Discussions (FGD), one to one interview, self -reporting through questionnaires and Dance Movement therapy-based workshops. Kolkata Sanved plans to engage Praxis for implemen ting this research.  This situation analysis will be a community led research where the youth and community members will be involved in the research process. For example, having a discussion with them to develop research questions in order to design the intervention around their needs.  The formative research will largely focus on the current reality of North Bengal Youth whether the planned intervention will fulfil the needs and complement those reality. The research will include sample locations with a mi x of socio -cultural identities, including gender and a few other categories such as education, opportunity, aspirations. Ideally, we are planning for 3 locations in each district to get a comprehensive scenario. As this   Oak Application Form12 intervention will be focused on ment al health, wellbeing and agency building, we will also include a mental health expert in the team.  Phase 2: Implementation: 18 months In the second half of the project, our focus will be to implement the intervention plan in at least one block in Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong division, targeting approximately 100 youth through DMT-based regular training and workshops. Our goal is to create at least 20 youth leaders, engage 10 key influencers, and involve 200 community members.  Training Of Trainer with youth.

CAPACITY BUILDING  Will this grant contain funds specifically ear-marked for Capacity Building / Organizational Development (CB/OD) of your organization, or does the grant have a specific CB/OD component?  YES   Kolkata Sanved is in the process of creating its Centre for Cre ative Wellbeing and Social Change, where we have received our first funding support to lay down the infrastructure. This centre will gradually transform into an institute. With the establishment of the institute, Kolkata Sanved has a tremendous opportunity  to leverage its partnerships and revenue -generating activities. Our goal is to create Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) entrepreneurs from this institute. The institute will serve as a hub for training programs, workshops, and academic courses, attracting both students and professionals from various regions.   Kolkata Sanved is unique in its commitment towards staff well -being and skill building, leading to organizational enhancement. We firmly believe that capacity building of staff contributes to the strength  of the organization which aids in its growth and impact in the sector. We believe in and practice honoring lived experience. The power of lived experiences is encapsulated in our model and reflected in our programme and journey. 60% of our employees have emerged from grass root backgrounds, a testament to our inclusive ethos. Their presence extends not only within the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) but also our governing body.   Presently, we are actively engaged in strengthening our second -line leaders (SLT), aiming to develop a Collective Leadership Model within the organization. To develop this model, Kolkata Sanved intends to invest on a process -based approach on its SLT over a span of 3 years. This model ensures that leadership is distributed across the organization, tapping   Oak Application Form13 into diverse perspectives and expertise. Additionally, this model empowers employees at all levels, creating a sense of ownership and commitment to the organization's mission.   The trainings under this model will include personal growth sessions, group development workshops, strategic planning workshops, and mentorship sessions. By prioritizing these aspects, KS fosters a culture of reflective leadership, where leaders are encouraged to continuously learn and grow. This not only benefits the individual employees but also creates a work environment where everyone feels supported, valued, and empowered to contribute effectively.  The activities will include:  1. Personal Growth sessions: Personal growth sessions give employees opportunity to nurture self -awareness, resilience, and emotional intelligence which are essential qualities for effective leadership. Improved mental health leads to higher productivity and better decision-making skill. This activity will comprise of a total of 20 group personal growth sessions for 5 groups @ 4 sessions per group per year for 3 years.  2. Group Development workshops: These workshops will emphasize on team building and strengthening efforts with specific focus on nurturing communication skills, feedback skills, appreciative inquiry and creating a sense of ownership. It also helps in creating a supportive work place environment. This will comprise of 4 days of workshops per year, for 3 years with the entire KS team.  3. Strategic Planning workshops: These workshops will help to create the framework and develop key principles of Collective Leadership Model. It will comprise of 4 days of workshop with the SLT in year 1 and 2 days of review workshop in year 2.  4. Mentorship sessions: These sessions are required for mentoring SLT members on a regular basis on issue -based understanding of the working field as some members come from non-academic background and did not get the opportunity for a ttending formal education. They have mostly acquired knowledge on the sector through lived experiences. This will include 2 days of session and 1 day assessment (total 3 days), every 6 months for 3 years.
